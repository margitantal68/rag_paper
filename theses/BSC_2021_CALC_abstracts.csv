Benedek Szabolcs,Travel companion search app,"The web application built for the exam has been named „The Ride” and the purpose behind
is to create a well designed and responsive platform for people who want to travel, commute and
explore. The inspiration behind the idea was the fact that there are a number of Facebook groups
meant to simplify the search for ride sharing, however, there are not that many individual
applications built for this purpose. This was the source of inspiration behind my web application.
An important factor for the project was that it must provide an added value compared to
similar solutions, for example Blablacar that is currently available in our country. Facebook groups
are more widespread compared to other ride sharing applications due to the personal aspect of the
social media platform. Blablacar is an international company whose application is used in multiple
countries, which is the reason why building a community is more difficult there. „The Ride”, on
the other hand, is only available for regions in Romania and Hungary, which meant to build a
stronger, more familiar connection with the local users.
My goal for the application was to be able to create the entire route when adding a new
ride, as well as to provide a breakdown of locations that the ride is passing through. It’s crucial
that the users are provided with good recommendations for rides. This functionality is built with
the help of Google Maps APIs which will be discussed further in the exam paper."
Blenesi Aron,Sapi3D tour – 3D model,"The technologies we use in our everyday lives make our lives a lot easier: with a simple mobile
device, we can pay bills or even make a video call while we are on the train. In addition to these, new
demands have emerged, such as getting through the virtual world to places we have never been to.

In this dissertation, we present the creation of a complete 3D model of the main building of the
Sapientia EMTE, which also includes a web UI presented in another dissertation, thus creating a
virtual tour of the university. The developed model is incorporated into the web application as a static
element. The structural structure of the model was based on the real layout plans and architectural
plans of the main building. In contrast to series of photograph based approaches, this method allows
the user to better perceive the spatial location of elements.

The model was created using Blender, an open source modeling software. The developed model
allows us to reach any point, from any angle, thus giving the user the opportunity to navigate freely. At
the same time, we have planned different routes between the most important points of the university,
which help us to get to the secretariat, departments or laboratory rooms, more easily. We also placed a
virtual billboard at certain points in the model. Information about various universities and events can
be displayed on these."
Bustya Balazs,Implementation of artificial neural networks by high-level synthesis,"Artificial neural networks have gained great popularity for their accuracy in image processing,
data mining, classification tasks, and decision-making systems in which previously only humans
were able to make the right decisions. However, neural networks cannot yet completely replace
humans, because humans design them depending on the given task. Hardware accelerators are
used to increase the performance of neural networks. There have been plenty of studies on
hardware accelerators in recent years. One of the options are FPGA circuits. The main advantages
of FPGAs used for hardware acceleration are parallelism, low power consumption and flexibility.
Implementing neural networks on FPGA is a very time consuming and difficult task, that can only
be performed by experienced professionals. The framework we have developed provides solution
to this problem. The purpose of the framework is to accelerate and facilitate the implementation
of neural networks ""running"" on an FPGA, to accelerate neural networks, to study optimization
options in terms of size and performance, and to automate the programming process. The
parameterizable neural network models, implemented by the high-level synthesis discussed in the
dissertation, serve as the basis of the framework, that generates the code of the neural networks
modelled in C ++ optimized by directives. The Vivado HLS tool generates the IP core of the neural
network from this code. It automatically integrates into a system built in Vivado. The Vivado tool
generates the bit file needed to program the FPGA and programs the circuit. The paper includes
the implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network and a radial basis function network,
hardware implementations of nonlinear activation functions, comparison of fixed-point and
floating-point number representations."
Dobri Ervin,GESTURE-CONTROLLED EMG STRAP INTERACTIVE USE FOR FLATFOOT TREATMENT,"Flat foot is one of the most common orthopedic problems, which in the absence of gradual treatment
and correction can also result in serious health problems later on. This unpleasant orthopedic lesion
can be treated efficiently with persistent exercise of the foot, with physiotherapy.

Unfortunately, most children are bored with the monotony of physiotherapy, in order to crea-
te consistent perseverance they need the constant supervision, persuasion and encouragement of the

physiotherapist and parents. On the other hand, children love to play, so putting physiotherapy in a
playful framework can make the rehabilitation process easier for everyone and increase its efficiency.

In the dissertation I present a self-developed “serious game” framework, with the help of which vi-
deo games can be controlled with the physiotherapy exercises used in the treatment of the flat foot: the

games are controlled by the movement of the foot instead of pressing a key/button. The system detects
the exercises in (near) real time from signals summing up the muscle activity provided by the EMG
(Electromyography) band placed on the child’s leg, and then simulates the keystroke corresponding to
the exercise in the currently running game, thereby controlling it."
Gall Janos,Design and development of a RISC processor with FPGA circuit testing,"The dissertation presents a processor designed and implemented for an FPGA circuit, which I modeled
on the Xilinx PicoBlaze processor. In this paper, I present the steps of design, construction, and testing.
Nowadays, computer technology is developing extremely fast, with redesigning and optimizing
various elements. The processor is one of the most important components of a computer that executes
instructions and controls the entire system.
There are several types of processor architectures, such as Harvard and Neumann architectures. I
built the processor presented in my dissertation on the principles of Harvard architecture. However,
I also used a two-phase piping to make better use of the processor. This allows you to perform
operations much faster.
During the design of the processor, I also took into account the RISC design strategy, the essence
of which is that the processor has a small number and simple instructions. This makes planning easier
and faster.

The aim of the dissertation is to compare the two processors, PicoBlaze and the processor I de-
signed and developed. In terms of computational performance and process control performance. The

tests performed can be divided into two groups, arithmetic tests and analog signal sampling tests.
During arithmetic tests, I examined Factorization and Fibonacci number sequence generation for
both processors. During analog signal sampling, processors had to reproduce sine and square signals
of different frequencies."
Hammas Attila,Framework for implementing artificial neural networks on reconfigurable digital circuits,"Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used in solving problems like image processing,
data mining, or classification. Hardware accelerators are used for increasing the performance

and efficiency of neural networks. An option for implementing such an accelerator is an FPGA-
based system, although developing neural networks for FPGAs is very time-consuming and

requires professionals to do it. In this article, we try to tackle this problem by creating a
framework that should speed up the process. At the same time, we will take a look at some
efficiency optimization and speed-up options as well. The framework is written in Python and
generates a C++ code whit HLS directives. This code can be compiled by Vivado HLS into a
hardware descriptive language and packaged as an IP. The Vivado tool can generate a bit file
that can be uploaded onto the FPGA device.
Among other things, the dissertation presents a comparison of different approximations of
nonlinear transformations (base functions and activation functions) in terms of accuracy,
required resource, and delay needed for evaluating the transformation. The generated neural
network module was integrated into a system, that we developed. Using that system, we tested
the neural network module and compared it with the models implemented in Python."
Kalith Norbert,Phone-based attendance,"The theme of my thesis is the design and implementation of a progressive web application to
help teachers and students manage and track attendance.
Attendance management is a frequently recurring activity in order to allow instructors to keep
track of students' attendance in class. Most teachers use traditional methods to record attendance.
The main drawback of these methods is that they are time-consuming processes. By using digital
tools, the time spent on this activity can be minimized and attendance recording is more
transparent for both teachers and students.
The aim of this thesis was to design and build an application that would facilitate and speed up
the process of attendance management by taking advantage of the benefits of technology. To
produce the software, I tested and used a new software development methodology called
Progressive Web Application. I created a platform-independent application that uses the Web

NFC API technology to manage presences quickly and reliably, and I also created an Android-
based native application that uses Bluetooth technology in case the user's mobile device is not

capable of using NFC technology.
The result was a multi-platform progressive web application and a native application. Both
software, taking into account the epidemiological situation, provide a contactless presence
tracking and speed up and facilitate the management and tracking of the presence."
Magyarosi Roland,Personal Assistant – DesktopApp,"Nowadays less and less attention is given to development and modernizing of Desktop
applications over web and mobile. Although Desktop applications have an important role in the
lives of users and IT workers. With the quick evolution of mobile phones practically everything
is possible using the smartphone in our pocket, but it couldn’t and probably will not be able to
surpass computers for a while.
The dissertation focuses on a system designed for personal computers or laptops that
perfectly meets the role of a virtual assistant in our life. The IPA (intelligent personal assistant)

softwares help the uses perform easy, but frequent tasks like browsing the internet, sending e-
mails and swiftly opening applications while the input is not codes or signals, but simply a

human voice. Presumably this is the reason for the success of this science that has grown into an
industry.
Virtual assistants are the blessing of the 21st century, but their history dates back to 1920.
Every assistant is different, but their purpose is the same: serving the user. In our case a user is
person in front of a computer whose job Sapientia Sarah tries to make easier, with performing
simple, but frequent commands. This technology is accessible on both smartphones, computers
and recently in household appliances and cars as well.
In my dissertation I studied desktop applications and development of these, voice
recognition, executing voice commands and the structure, use and development of virtual
assistants. Keywords: virtual assistant, desktop application, user, technology"
Nagy-Serban Tunde,Sapi3D tour – UI,"This disertation presents a web application, which includes the 3D virtual tour of Sapientia Hungarian
University of Transilvania, Faculty of Tehnical and Human Sciences, from Târgu Mures,
.

Nowadays, people in big part of the day are in the influence of digitalization. Most of the people
has at least a smatphone, a pc or a laptop and with these also has the connection to the internet, which
gives infinite possibilities.
Digitalization introduces a lot of good features for humanity. Problems can be solved with using
the internet and a digital device, for example: paying bills, keeping the relation with relatives and not
least with the help of the virtual tours, people can reach places, where they never could be.
This dissertation it is about a web application, which uses and displays a 3D model from the
building of the university, creating a virtual tour of it. To this tour can attend anyone and with this,
the posibility is given to have a look inside the building. Beside this has an informational purpose,

because the application shows a lot of information about the university, for example: events (Sapi-
Line-Tracer), or the name and the contact of the specialist coordinators.

The application has a feature with the name “Take me!”, which takes the user to the selected place
and also shows the route to reach there, giving a lot of help for visitors. Beside this the user has the
possibility to walk anywhere inside the model and with this the user can discover the complete model.
The system was made on web interface and thanks to this it can be used almost on all the devices
like on pc, laptop and also on smartphone. The application can give a lot of help for the new students
and also for the students and teachers who are only in visit to familiarize in a faster way with the main
building of the university."
Palfi Szabolcs,Price Monitor,"These days the majority of shopping is done online. There are tons of online shopping websites, with
some kind of big sale going on almost all the time, however these sales are most of the time made up.
These false sales can be spotted only if you follow a products price daily, for a longer period of time
which is a repetitive and time-consuming process. The same can be said when you’re interested in
purchasing some products but you’re not quite decided yet, so you want to wait for the price to drop.
These gave the inspiration for developing our system.

In this paper we’ll present a price monitoring system which automates the process described earli-
er. At predefined moments the system wakes up and scrapes publicly available data from the Internet,

which are than saved. The user has the opportunity to add products to his list, for them to be followed,
and can view the price change on a chart. All this can be done from a Chrome browser extension or
a mobile application built with Flutter. The so-called heart of the system is a python script which is
responsible for the mining of the data, periodically updating the prices and pushing new products into
the database. All this is done while respecting all moral and legal boundaries. All of our data is stored
in a Realtime Database provided by Firebase, which turned out to be perfect for our application.

After months of gathering data, while using the system, we analyzed it and made a few conclu-
sions. We saw multiple patterns emerging from the price changes but there is not one that matches

every product. There were many scams regarding prices, especially during Black Friday but there we-
re also real and significant price drops as well. After using the system for a longer period of time we

can say that a software like this helps the buyers in making a purchase decision, by providing useful
data in a easy to read form."
Simo Zsuzsa,"Remote-controlled, portable mechanical ventilator to assist patients with respiratory problems","Due to the lung damage caused by the epidemics, the need for high-efficiency, mobile
ventilators that isolate operating personnel from the patient is growing worldwide. The aim is to
develop a complementary system for remote patient monitoring and controlling which can act
fully as a noninvasive artificial respiration assistant that represents a new approach in the field of
mechanical ventilators. We have combined a completely new concept ventilation mechanism
with a modern ESP32 microcontroller-based control system and a program installed on a mobile
graphical user interface that allows these machines to be easily carried, operated and controlled,
while also providing closed-loop breath control. Two-way, remote monitoring and control based
on Internet of Things (IoT) technology allows an authorized physician connected to a wireless
network to monitor respiratory parameters and adjust settings in real time, track multiple patients
simultaneously, or even make clinical decisions,without having to come into direct contact with
the device or the patient.
The parameters controlled and regulated by our machine, as well as their minimum and
maximum limits, comply with the RMVS001 regulations of the international institute Medicines
& Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency."
Solyom Botond-Ors,Android phone contact tracking apps,"My license thesis aim is to realize an application, which is able to save my appointments,
back to a specific time limit. In our days the concept of security it becomes more and more
important in every area of our life, therefore the preservation of this, takes precedence keeping our
human life.
The acceleration of the world, involves the increase of meetings and contacts between
people and the regular formation of this. An exponential increase of these contacts resulting from
these meetings becomes a defining motive of our accelerated world. Unfortunately, in some cases
it creates a negative effect in our lives, it can prevent the opportunity of preserving the security.
The frequently encounters, the multitude of contacts between people, in some cases can be a threat
to our heath and the safety of our material assets.
During the creation of my license thesis, my goal was the implementation of an application
which, with the help of Bluetooth technology, can follow where and with whom we meet and
pursues a certain time limit, which we are spending with a certain person. If it is necessary warns
the users about a potential contact that could pose a danger of their safety.
The application was successfully implemented in the Android development environment,
with the help of Bluetooth technology integrated in the smartphones.
As a result, we get a phone application running on an Android operating system which can
be used in case of pandemic, or in any case when is required the contact research, but it can also
be used even for personal reason for the tracking of our own movements and meetings."
Szasz Arnold-Levente,Stroke Monitor,"Today, thanks to technological breakthroughs, mobile phones have a computing capacity
unimaginable in the past. In addition to phone calls and messaging, these devices have many new
features. To achieve user experience at the highest level, they need a lot of sensors and
communication modules. In addition, phones can be equipped with various accessories associated
with new sensors, making it possible to continuously monitor vital signs.
The purpose of this diploma work is to develop a system that would benefit from the
possibilities offered by sensors. The Stroke Monitor application includes two different software,
which consists of a telephone application and a smartwatch application, their interaction allowing
the user to monitor their heart rate even outside the hospital. The purpose of monitoring is to inform
the user and the contact person in case of a possible risk of stroke which is implemented based on
the data provided by the smartwatch and processed by the telephone application. It plays an
important role for vulnerable users, because early medical emergency measures reduce the
aftermath of stroke. The telephone application is also able to display various graphs, determine the
risk score, provide daily advice to prevent the risk of stroke. During the development of the system,
we used flutter technology, so the application is platform independent.
The diploma thesis includes the definition of stroke, and it is recognition based on heart
rate, design, implementation and development of telephone and smartwatch applications, as well
as testing the system in real conditions."
Udvari Balazs,Class Response System,"The main subject of my thesis are Class Response Systems, software applications created
in order to help real time teaching methods. During the last years one of my main interest was the
transformation of high school or university lectures by introducing interactivity and creating a
better learning experience for the students. Consequently, my scope was the creation of a freely
usable, low cost, platform independent CRS application, usable during traditional and online
classes also. Creating the application, my long distance goal is to measure the efficiency of
classroom teaching. Nowadays educational institutions frequently face problems caused by the
distraction of students attention during classes by Internet connected smart devices. But smart
devices, like mobile phones owned by almost all students could be used also for raising the
efficiency of understanding during classes. Here are CRS systems coming in. In my thesis I present
the basic concepts of CRS applications, compare some of widely used CRS systems, afterwards I
present the project phases of my own CRS system, including testing and it’s usage in schools. My
CRS application, called answeRS is a Node.js based web application which includes the basic
functionalities of a CRS methods. The application assures teachers to display question queues
during classes in real time, student responses are collected by using their mobile phones. Teachers
can evaluate responses instantly, and consider the result for the next part of the lecture. Testing of
the application with multiple users was made under real online condition and requirements were
fulfilled."
Ujfalvi Csongor-Robert,SYSTEM FOR VOLUMETRIC VISUALIZATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING DATA,"Even today deaths caused by brain tumors are in the scale of hundreds of thousands globally.
Thanks to the rapid improvement of medical sciences and other branches of science nowadays
there are numerous different systems helping medical professionals to diagnose brain tumors
faster than before they have started using them. After the diagnosis, on average brain tumor
patients live only a few more months than a year, so it’s essential to accelerate the process of
diagnosing the tumors to start treating the patients before it’s too late.
The topic of my thesis is a software that makes the development and testing of algorithms
which are segmenting and mapping brain tumors from volumetric MRI data. The application is
able to display in 4K resolution the segmented and mapped brain records alongside with the key
indicators, results and statistical data on screen. Also it can store these data in a database and
make it readily available to query it later for future uses.
During the process of designing the software I’ve used many software design patterns and
principles. While developing the application I’ve used many open source and free Microsoft
products, including frameworks, developer tools and libraries."
