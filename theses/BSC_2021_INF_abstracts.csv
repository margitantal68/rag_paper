Molnar Tamas ,Holiday management application," The topic of my thesis is the presentation of a web application that makes it easier to manage the days off of employees within a company. In a larger company, as the number of employees increases, it becomes more and more difficult for management to handle the allocation of days off. At the same time, employees also face difficulties in the application process, which is not the same for all workplaces and may even vary from time to time within a company. The application aims to overcome these problems. To achieve this goal, I decided to create a web application. One of the main aspects of the application is to make everyone’s job easier; therefore, it should also be easy to access without having to go through the installation process on each device separately. At the same time, the development does not have to take into account the specific requirements of different operating systems. All you need is a device that can connect to the Internet and has a browser.

In this thesis, I will describe the architecture of the application, how it works, and the technologies used to implement it. I will describe the frameworks used, their characteristics, and how they have contributed to the implementation of my application. Technology has been a part of our everyday lives for quite some time now, hence similar applications already exist. Therefore, I think it is important to mention and compare my own application with these and highlight why my application is more suitable for a company.

Finally, I will summarize the features implemented in the application and the opportunities they offer. In addition, I consider it important to set goals for the future so that the application can meet the expectations that will arise in the meantime and by adding further features, make the work of the company and its employees even easier."
Toducz Endre ,Algorithm analysis software based on graph theoretical aspects," The computer science gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the beauty of algorithms. As a beginner, we write and test short codes and browse the implementation of famous algorithms, learning about their logic's beauty. During our studies, we are quickly introduced to basic ordering algorithms and graph theory. While dissecting the ordering algorithms, an interesting question arose, and the answer was obtained by looking at an emerging problem from a graph-theoretic point of view. The problem led us to start investigating ordering algorithms using graph theory. This led me to develop a software tool to investigate algorithms using graph theory. In this thesis, I present the process of developing an algorithm testing software tool using different programming techniques. The paper includes the theoretical background, design and implementation of the software tool. The tool will be useful for novice programmers and for enthusiastic individuals too who want to gain insight into basic ordering algorithms and other small pieces of code by using graphs. The tool can be used as a teaching aid, as it facilitates the understanding of the algorithm, and can also be used in teaching graph theory."
Felmeri Zsolt ,Keylogger," The aim of my thesis is to implement a software-based keylogger with more functionalities than an average keylogger. Worldwide, there is at least one computer or machine running an operating system in almost every building (as we know). Therefore, care must be taken in order not to become a victim of a virtual attack. After entering the world of the Internet, there has been a growing threat from malware. Therefore, I tried to develop a software-based keylogger from the perspective of an attacker, i.e., a hacker. However, I was not only interested in the perspective of an attacker but also wanted to know how to prevent them. So, anti-virus programs prevent keyloggers from being installed on systems.

During my research, I noticed that keyloggers are also used in companies to monitor their computer systems. During the planning phase, the project had to be divided into two parts. Therefore, two softwares had to be designed: one will run on the hacker’s side and monitor the victim’s keystrokes, and the other one will be installed on the victim’s operating system. The victim side sends the data, and the hacker side receives it. The data travels over the network; therefore, it is a good idea to encrypt the packets. For example, with well-monitored systems, packets traveling on the network can be tracked. The purpose of encryption is to prevent anyone from interpreting the content of a package.

I used common operating systems for testing, both on virtual machines and real machines as well. My goal was to capture sensitive data from the victims, such as passwords. In conclusion, we determine which operating system it is possible to obtain the login password from the user and which operating systems this process fails on."
Gergely Zsolt ,User authentication based on PIN code typing dynamics," In information systems, the access to services is mostly based on authentication to protect the system and user information. In authentication systems, we distinguish two main types: entry-based and continuous authentication systems. Based on the reliability of the authentication system, both types can be divided into primary and secondary methods.

In my research, I examine a secondary authentication system based on behavioral biometrics: authentication based on PIN-code typing dynamics. This system assumes primarily the knowledge of the PIN-code while secondarily it checks its typing rhythm. The typing rhythm as a behavioral biometric is a long-researched area; however, very few research have been conducted in connection to PIN-code typing rhythms.

Initially, such systems used 4 digit-PIN codes for authentication, today the use of 6 digit PIN-codes is getting popular. In the first part of my research, I created a data collector application that collects the typing information from users with the help of a software keyboard. With the help of the software, we collected 20 typing samples of 6 digit PIN-codes from 112 people.

I tried several anomaly detectors, but the best results were provided by the scaled Manhattan detector: 0.126 equal error rate (EER) and 0.925 area under the curve (AUC). In the second part of my research, I incorporated the developed method into an Android software component that any application running on an Android phone can simply use by specifying dependencies.

Both the data collector and the Android software component source codes are publicly available on GitHub."
Bartalus Csaba Zsolt ,Implementing a blockchain system behind cryptocurrencies," In my dissertation, I will present how a cryptocurrency is built using a blockchain structure. I will talk about cryptographic systems that allow the use of a blockchain. In the presentation of my project, we will see step by step how we use cryptography and the blockchain structure in the world of cryptocurrencies. I will also show how transactions are managed in the case of cryptocurrencies. It will also be about mining cryptocurrencies and the basics. I will discuss the differences and similarities between current cryptocurrencies as well as what system is worth using in the current context.

Since 2008 in the digital world, more and more cryptocurrencies have appeared. Each system has been designed to be as secure as possible. Since we are talking about a coin, it is important to use algorithms that are as secure as possible, that are resistant to a possible attack and that make the task of the attacker as difficult as possible. These are the reasons why the presentation of such systems and the description of the necessary theories play an important role in my dissertation.

We will also see what systems we currently use, how these systems are built, and we will also receive an answer as to why we chose these systems. At the end of the dissertation, I will draw conclusions and talk about long-term plans and opportunities according to which I would like to make further developments and to make the project more optimal and complex."
Molnár Balázs ,Web application for analyzing and evaluating programming competition tasks," The topic of my dissertation is a web application that helps to analyze and evaluate programmer competition tasks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced a number of problems to be solved in almost every area of life. The education system had to go through enormous changes in order to be able to pass on the right level and quality of knowledge to future generations. In my dissertation, I tried to find a solution to such a problem.

The source of the problem is not new; it has been felt so far in the teaching of Hungarian programming. Students usually do not receive adequate feedback on the tasks they have prepared and submitted. They only receive a certain score, depending on the correctness of the solved tasks. Furthermore, so far there has been no online collection of tasks in Hungarian that provides help to those who do not have adequate foreign language skills.

This is how I came up with the idea to create a web-based application that is easy to access and use for anyone with internet access. The system is simple yet efficient, with many expansion options, and can be easily adapted to the needs of teachers and students.

Both students and teachers can register for the app. Each student can join a class created by their teacher and then complete dozens of assignments created or uploaded by either their own teacher or other teachers. The solutions developed and uploaded by the student can be easily evaluated by the lead teacher, and their effective development can be promoted with his suggestions.

Although it was very difficult to start, I am pleased to know that I finally achieved my primary goals to create a web application suitable for solving and evaluating competition-level tasks. Nevertheless, I had to realize that this was a huge project, with many opportunities for improvement that could be worked on for years. This was also proven when I found a number of applications that were similar in purpose to mine during my search for pre-existing web applications."
Bako Lorand ,Eigenface method used as an access control system," The topic of my thesis consists of the use of the eigenface method, which is an important part of principal component analysis (PCA). The face is one of the most important characteristics of the human body. Usually, by examining the human face, people can decide if a person is known or unknown to them. Recently, thanks to the development of technology and the world, people meet hundreds of human faces daily. With the knowledge of this fact, the question of whether there is a way in which the properties of the human face can be used in the virtual world arises. In studying the human face, significant aspects are the determination of different organs' position and the determination of specific characteristics (e.g., birthmarks). The analysis and knowledge of these elements help a lot in people’s identification both in the real and the virtual life.

People daily meet with a big amount of information and the human life is getting much more dependent on the elements of the virtual world. Thanks to these things, the identification of people and the access to different places based on their facial properties was just a matter of time. In this thesis, I will attempt to answer the question of whether the eigenface method deserves to be used as part of a two-factor authentication (2FA) or not. The method will be used as the system’s first security factor, which consists of the detection of a human face and recognition of a specific person. During the implementation, the main goal will be to make face recognition more efficient and precise. Based on the results, I will conclude if the technology used in my research is worth using and, based on my own results, if it is possible for the created system to be developed in a certain way."
Horvath Aron ,Numerical methods for nonlinear optimal control," Our world is highly complex, thus there are a lot of problems which we are not able to control. But the most dynamic systems can be written with mathematical equations, therefore we have some control over the system's behavior. The most frequently used method for this purpose is optimal control. With optimal control, we can solve the most linear and nonlinear problems that affect our everyday lives. The importance of this strategy speaks for itself, since it not only achieves results at an economic level (see Sebastian Sager [1]), but also saves human lives. For instance, the Dengue-fever was stopped in the 1960s: the disease's system can be written with a set of nonlinear differential equations, in which an educational campaign was also involved (see [2]). In the last few decades, optimal control has taken on enormous proportions, since these problems cannot be solved traditionally, with paper and pencil. In this paper, I will present two methods: multiple shooting and gradient descent. After that, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods."
Ballai Attila ,Analysis and synthesis of mouse dynamics," The topic of my thesis is the analysis and synthesis of mouse dynamics applying different methods, and besides that, mouse dynamics-based bot detection. Several bot detection systems are known using different methods to distinguish humans from bots based on website usage data. Most websites use some image or audio recognition techniques or character recognition to distinguish humans from bots. This is because there is no system yet which is able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interesting topic because with such a system, there would be no need anymore to recognize images or audio nor any cookie checking, like how Google bot detection works. Just a simple checkbox click would be enough. So in this thesis, I would like to analyze mouse dynamics performed by users inside a web application. I will illustrate them, examine what kind of features I could extract from them to classify users more precisely. Then, try some method to generate synthetic mouse movement data sets similar to humans in order to deceive bot detectors. Based on user classification results, we can conclude that user recognition based on mouse dynamics has a low accuracy. However, using features related to screen resolution improves recognition accuracy. Synthetic trajectories based on Bézier curves can be easily detected by almost any classifier."
Szabo Albert Balazs ,Recycling and Packaging Symbols Recognition Using Machine Learning," One of the urging problems of today's society is the proper reuse of products. The 79 percent of plastic waste is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, 12 percent is incinerated, and only 9 percent is recycled. Inadequate storage and improper, ineffective recycling of products can cause enormous damage. Every year, more than a hundred million marine organisms die as a result of pollution from plastic waste. Selective waste collection can be facilitated by the automatic recognition of environmental product labels on waste. The recognized symbols, together with educational information, can provide sufficient knowledge for users to make the process of selective waste collection more efficient and easier.

The current thesis is part of the Greensy project, focusing entirely on the problem of automatic recognition of recyclable symbols. It solves this using various machine learning methods, with a corpus designed specifically for this purpose. By creating a data set, it is possible to recognize environmental product labels from a different approach than attempts in the literature so far."
Marton Szilard ,Improving Home Security With Artiﬁcial Intelligence," Personal safety is playing an increasingly important role every day. As a result, the topic of my dissertation was the recognition of violence in homes using camera footages. The established system detects dangerous and violent scenes using its built-in artificial intelligence module and then notifies the appropriate person. Besides that, the system performs space surveillance and intrusion control. Additionally, it's scanning for violence detection. This module takes the use of surveillance cameras to a new level. So, if abnormal events occur, it will notify the user as quickly as possible so that they can react quickly to adverse events. The notification process is the top priority, as it notifies the user of events only if the system has been designed to do so if there is actually a problem. For the implementation and operation of these functionalities, the android phone application provides a suitable environment. We will use artificial intelligence methods to examine what is happening in a variety of ways, including sound and image-based evaluations, to determine what is happening on the camera and then calculate the hazard factor. Four artificial intelligence modules work in the background through a REST API, which is closely connected to a TCP server, also responsible for managing the connected users and processing the recordings of the cameras belonging to the users. A third component of the system is the client application already mentioned above, which provides the ability to track cameras and receive alarm notifications."
Kovacs Attila ,Comparison of stores and store chains by basket value," The topic of my research paper is the comparison of store prices: stores versus chain stores, based on shopping cart value. In this fast-paced and modern world, there's no time to read catalogs and brochures to compare prices. The problem is that there's a significant variance for the same shopping cart between stores and chain stores. Yet, there's a pressing need to address this issue because everyone's time is equally precious. The thematic concept is also justified by my personal experience. As a college boarding student, I had to be mindful of prices and where to buy the same products. Additionally, the ecological footprint of catalogs and brochures should not be overlooked.

The aim of my project is to develop a system that enables users to obtain quotes from various stores and chain stores, sorted by location and cart value (priorities in shopping), simply by assembling their shopping cart (a necessity). We will shop at all the stores and chain stores in the country, then purchase the chosen products from the store or chain store with the best results for us.

The project consists of three main components: a server (which hosts the website and android application), a website (for stores and store chains), and an android application (for end-users). Our goal is to create a modern system that meets today's standards, offering users a convenient, user-friendly, beautiful, and clear interface.

To illustrate the problem and proposed solution, I created the server and android application. In this paper, I will discuss the operation of the application, its architecture, the tools employed, and the design."
Incze Levente ,Problem providing and automatic correction software," The goal of the Kóditt platform is to offer exercises for high schoolers and first-year university students who want to acquire the basics of software engineering. At the same time, its second goal is to help improve and deepen the algorithmic thinking of students who pass the difficulty levels of the occurring exercises. In the XXI century, a beginner software engineer faces the fact that if they want to learn the basics of software engineering autonomously, they must first decide which programming language to choose. The first step in this process is to search for websites that can help them theoretically and practically. In most cases, if you want to reach these sites in Hungarian, you will not get any results. This is also confirmed by the evaluation of the answers to the pre-test questions: it may be useful to create a platform that can ensure the verification and correctness of code written in several programming languages. An added benefit of this platform may be that the requirements of the tasks are formulated in Hungarian. As the saying goes, “even Rome was not built in a day,” so the Kóditt platform is setting off on the road to its final destination with small steps. Currently, the Kóditt platform seeks to guide students from simple tasks to complex ones using the C++ programming language. The use of foreign languages on these kinds of platforms takes me back to my high school memories, reminding me of the many difficulties I had to deal with when I came across the phrasing of software engineering and math tasks in a foreign language. Kóditt thus provides a solution for Hungarian students to learn the basics of software engineering by practicing basic tasks that are automatically corrected by the implemented software."
Németh Franciska ,SAPI Virtual Assistant," The topic of my dissertation is the development of a software, which is a virtual assistant service provider for Sapientia University’s teachers, students and employees. It will be able to communicate in Hungarian. In today’s world, everything relies on technology, and there is no other way to choose virtual assistants. Nowadays, everyone has a virtual assistant on their mobile device. All of these virtual assistants have one thing in common: they mostly know English.

There are situations in life where a general virtual assistant is not enough. Even if we were satisfied that it could speak Hungarian, it would not be able to answer all our questions. For example, asking Cortana, Siri, or the Google Assistant, ""What is the email address of Sapientia’s Secretary?"", we would get answers such as:

- ""Sorry, I couldn’t understand.""
- ""These are the matches for Sapientia on the internet: «insert link here»""
- ""Would you like me to search for secretary?""

All possible answers would either be about not understanding or searching for keywords. Searching for keywords would not be that much of a problem, however we would prefer hearing the answer straight away, than being redirected to browse the web."
Dávid Tamás ,Ant colony algorithm and its types," The topic of my thesis is the investigation and comparison of the Ant Colony algorithm and its types. I will create a web application to make this task easier, which could also be used for educational purposes due to its animated algorithm visualization. In our accelerating world, we often prefer a fast and acceptably optimal solution over a slow but accurate one. The Ant Colony algorithm is particularly helpful in many industries because it guarantees a good solution in numerous cases.

The implemented web application assists us in various areas, as it offers other functionalities in addition to implementing five types of the Ant Colony algorithm. It can visualize them, save input data, show detailed results, and store them. With these tools, we can conduct measurements on a range of data sets using different parameter configurations and various types of algorithms. Based on the data obtained from the software, I will compare the different types of the Ant Colony algorithm, their advantages and disadvantages in different cases, and search for an optimal configuration that calculates a sufficiently optimal result within an acceptable runtime. In conclusion, I will determine which algorithm is generally and specifically for specific input data sets the most promising and worthy of further investigation."
Peter Kristof ,Large image collection visualization and browsing," Nowadays, there are many image collection management programs that help the user to search through their images visualized in different ways. The aim of my thesis is to develop a software that allows the user to visualize very large image collections, search between images, create new collections, sort and select images from these collections according to different criteria.

This software is capable of loading large sets of images, extracting various information from the images, and also storing and managing them. It allows for displaying image collections in different formats and sorting the images based on previously extracted data, all through a user-friendly interface. All you need to run it is a medium-level computer that matches the current technology.

The search in image collections is based on the well-known CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) methods, with the great advantage of being able to extract information from large image sets without any special intervention. The extraction of other information from images, in this case metadata, has been solved by a free and easy-to-use metadata retrieval library.

The NoSQL local database provided by MongoDB is responsible for storing this data, with the great advantage of being able to perform read-write operations quickly. The application is based on various Java-based technologies.

In terms of programming languages, there are several arguments in favor of Java: the rich set of standard and third-party libraries that I have used regularly; scalability; security; and last but not least, the fact that it is available for free."
Bartalis Zoltan Krisztian ,SapiFeedback: An online system for anonymous feedback analysis," The aim of my thesis is to analyze anonymous feedback to draw the right conclusions regarding a given topic. In real life, we often need feedback to make the right decisions and changes for the future. Anonymous feedback gives a more clear picture about reality than not anonymous feedback because it's in human nature that we don't give honest feedback or don't give feedback at all when its content is negative. For instance, when a teacher expects feedback from his/her students about the quality of lessons and teaching methods. In such situations, it's really important for people to get realistic feedback to learn, improve, and make the right conclusions. In this project, a user-friendly and efficient software was implemented which allows collecting, analyzing, and visualizing anonymous feedback. An initial version of this application was published at the beginning of this semester to allow for a case study. Therefore, students applying for the Object-oriented programming course had the opportunity to give anonymous feedback. The application allows registered users to create topics for which they request anonymous feedbacks. Within a topic, questions can be formulated to motivate participants for feedback. Feedbacks are collected, analyzed, and visualized using word clouds."
Farkas Andrea-Szilvia ,Data compression using PCA," The aim of my thesis is to use principal component analysis (PCA) for the compression of digital image files. In my research, I compare different methods for achieving this goal and experiment with varying constant values for effective implementation. With the growing need for storage and data traffic in the modern internet, reducing image sizes is essential. There are multiple methods for image compression, and in my thesis, I focus on using principal component analysis. PCA is a statistical technique that involves finding so-called principal components specific to the dataset. After compression, we store only the coefficients of these components. The number of principal components can be increased arbitrarily to optimize accuracy, although this increases the size of the resulting compressed image data files. Since the goodness value of the compressed data is measurable and comparable, finding the best method for compression becomes relatively easy.

In my thesis, I aim to answer the following questions: what specific characteristics of images influence the goodness of compression? What changes are observable between different implementations of PCA, and how do these affect the image's goodness and the time required for compression? I compare and evaluate these results using multiple methods for measuring the goodness of the resulting images after compression. My research primarily focuses on utilizing existing PCA implementation to find answers to the posed questions."
Vaida Márk-Ádám ,Improving Home Security With Artificial Intelligence," The development of technology gives opportunities to improve our everyday tools with new, useful features. Security systems are not exceptions. Computer vision provides a chance to classify objects, persons, body parts or face expressions. Taking advantage of computers, it is possible to build a system that can make decisions and notify the user. Using this technology, my colleague, Marton Szilárd, and I have created a security system using artificial intelligence methods. This system is able to identify persons from pictures taken by a security camera and decide based on human movement if an action is violent or not. It does all of this using built-in face, emotion, voice, and movement recognition. The system has two parts. The first part is a mobile application which notifies the user in case of burglary and violence detection. The application gives the user the possibility to customize the system, provides a way to check cameras and notification history. The second part of the system is a server which can process images and make decisions based on the content of an image, doing all of this using artificial intelligence. The system can be used as a smart security system as well as for detecting domestic violence."
Szabo Henrietta ,Pixel sorting," The topic of my paper is to examine and recreate pixel sorting methods within an Android application. There are a lot of possibilities to edit and correct our images, either with difficult image editing programs or with simple filters, with a click. To get the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods. Generally, you have to dispose of editorial knowledge, and it is a time-consuming operation. At present, there are few applications where you can apply this method simply and rapidly.

The glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from the same method due to the fact that every image is different. So, we cannot know what we achieve until we try the method on the given image. In addition, it belongs to such an area which is developing in our days and can be developed also by ourselves, given that there are a lot of possibilities, and the limits to create these methods are only what you can imagine.

On preparing my paper, I designed an application by means of which we can edit our images easily and simply, by the help of different glitch filters for pixel sorting. Behind the filters applied on our images, different pixel sorting algorithms make it possible within the application to achieve the desired effect. Each filter is sorting the pixels under well-defined conditions and criteria so that the effect should be as aesthetic as possible.

It was a challenge to find such methods which can work quickly also with a higher pixel number. Besides, it was important to experiment with those methods which not only sort but also modify the pixels on the image so that one can achieve a spectacular, aesthetic and pleasing effect. All these in a creative way by the aid of randomness, all the same with punctually designed algorithms."
Makkai Nandor ,Computer-based morphological and syntactic analysis of texts in Hungarian," Nowadays, natural language processing is much more widespread. More and more language analysis tools, chatbots, virtual assistants, translator programs appear on the market. After the conversion to distance education, as a result of the pandemic, there is an increasing need for online learning software. My major aim is creating a software which is capable of processing texts written in the Hungarian language. It should be able to do morphological analysis and is able to perform syntactic analysis. Last but not least, it provides an opportunity to estimate the user’s knowledge and access the necessary theory. I used .Net technologies to implement the application. I wrote the code in C# and the user interface was realized in Blazor framework. In terms of usability, it can benefit all Hungarian grammar students, or even students studying applied linguistics at our university."
Halasz Botond ,Recognition of traffic signs using neural network on Android operating system," My thesis is: ""The recognition of traffic signs using neural networks on an Android operating system.""

Nowadays, more and more people have their own cars, and this number is growing. The problem is that many drivers ignore the traffic signs found on the roads. Inexperienced drivers may not intentionally ignore them, while more experienced drivers sometimes pay less attention. This is where my Traffic Signs app comes in, which specializes in traffic sign recognition. It is useful for both novice and experienced drivers because it is informative, allowing users to learn new things from certain traffic signs in Romania. Additionally, it has a live monitoring feature that identifies and informs users of traffic signs in real time.

While careful driving is facilitated by routine and focus, the absence of these can make even a modern motor vehicle a great help because it alerts drivers about warnings, marks, and road hazards. Most modern vehicles have such systems, but not everyone can afford to buy them. Instead, users can install the app on an Android phone with a camera and start the app, placing it behind the windshield in a clear position.

The purpose of the application is to identify potential dangers on the road and notify users of traffic signs. Ignoring a stop sign can be a significant risk. The benefits of this app include improving drivers' awareness by constantly informing them about overlooked traffic signs, making them more mindful of their own carelessness, and keeping track of the signs they have encountered for potential future use."
Császár Ákos ,Local Trader," The topic of my thesis is the development of an application that makes the everyday life of artisans easier. The application can optimize and boost their productivity, help with advertising, and track orders sent by clients. Nowadays, the mobile phone is one of the most popular devices because we can perform quite complex tasks on them with just a few taps. Taking advantage of the popularity of these tools, I developed an android application and a server. In doing so, I kept in mind what functions are possible and worth creating to make the system fast, scalable, and secure. Additionally, I prioritized the look and simplicity of the client-side application to provide the best possible user experience. The dissertation covers the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies used, basic security and optimization problems and solutions, and answers the question of what trade-offs we need to make during development for the technologies used. Today's modern tools often speed up the development process, but they may not provide an easy and effective solution for everything."
Lorincz Csaba ,Development of a starter package for MDM applications," The theme of my thesis is ""Mobile Device Management"" and its different implementation methods, as well as uses. Mobile Device Management is a software designed to standardize and simplify the use of mobile devices. The aim of MDM is a client-server architecture which enhances security and removes complexities from the user’s tasks. Its most important role is to enforce different policies, such as banning or restricting different applications or websites. For an MDM system, it is crucial that the application be reliable and well-maintained. It is a priority for the application to run fast and be efficient, so the user will not be bothered during important tasks. One of the most significant expectations of users is security and the discreet handling of private data. Last but not least, it is important for the user to have choices based on personal needs and economic situation.

The aim of my current thesis is to map the currently most popular MDM options on the market, compare their capabilities, as well as use the identified data to diagnose user requirements and expectations. Beyond the market analysis, it is part of the goal to develop my own ""starter pack."" The starter pack I develop is a simple and easy-to-expand basic application which can be used as a foundation for more robust products. It consists of a simple web API and a mobile application. After the presentation of the research and the development, it becomes deducible which technology, or technologies, are worthwhile to use in the development or use of such projects."
Nagy Szilárd Levente ,Multi-platform advertising system," Nowadays, more and more people are making purchases over the internet and doing this from different types of devices, running different operating systems. Therefore, it is important to design a software that is platform-independent and available from different devices. The aim of this thesis is the implementation of a multi-platform advertising system that helps students and other users to create, share and search between ads. This concentrates supply and demand in one place, making it more likely that your ads will reach your target audience, making it easier for you to search for ads that fall into different categories. In my thesis, I present the existing functionalities of the system, the design process and architecture, and the subsequent implementation, showing how to create multi-platform software from a single code base that is accessible from a website and mobile application."
Izsak Andrea ,"""Need a tutor?"": Reservation System"," Nowadays, traditional, personal reservations have been replaced by reservations on the phone or on other public sites. This is true for beauty salons, doctor’s offices, sports events, and anything else. The purpose of the ""Need a Tutor?"" Reservation System application is to make appointments for individuals as quick and efficient as possible.

The project will implement two-way communication between the two target groups. One of the target audiences are students who require private lessons. Within the framework of the application, they will have the opportunity to view the data sheets of all the teachers they are interested in and see the teachers’ free time. All you need to do is register, which you can easily do by entering your email address, username, and password.

The other target audience is a group of teachers who give lessons in one subject or several different ones. They have the opportunity to modify their calendars to suit their own needs.

The software system has two main components: an application for users running on Android and IOS platforms and an application server that retrieves data from a database. The paper contains the ways of operation of the project, the technologies used for its implementation, the functionality, and a description of the further development opportunities."
Biró Tünde Anna ,Online image visualization of large image collections," Nowadays, days the increasing number of photographs leads to the development of new image visualization programs. Today, there are multiple software that can do this. The aim of this project is to develop a software which allows the user to create image collections consisting of thousands of pictures and visualize them very quickly (in just a few seconds), and the user has multiple methods to organize these pictures.

I developed a web application which can be separated into two parts: the server backend part and the client side. The server module is written in C# language, within that I used ASP.NET MVC framework, which is based on the MVC design pattern. The client side is using WebGL for image visualization.

WebGL is a graphic library for web interfaces."
Mozes Botond ,Online Signature Verification using Deep Learning," Nowadays, a lot of people use smartphones that make everyday life easier. With these tools, we can easily manage our subscriptions, bank accounts, and other personal data. Protecting user data is very important. In addition to passwords, patterns, and PIN codes, biometric methods for data protection are becoming more common. Biometric methods are harder to copy, so they provide stronger protection for our data. In addition to the methods used so far (fingerprint, face recognition, voice recognition), signature-based authentication is becoming more and more common. Smartphones with large displays allow users to draw signatures with their fingers. The aim of my thesis is to investigate online signature-based authentication. I built a convolutional neural network for feature extraction. I built different models using features extracted and processed from the signatures. I studied the accuracy and resource requirements of these models using the signatures from two publicly available datasets. I fine-tuned the models for maximum accuracy. The goal was to prevent the system from accepting fake signatures and rejecting the original user as few times as possible.

To test the models, I created my own Android application, which consists of two parts. In the enrollment phase, the system builds the template or learns the features extracted from the signature. After the enrollment phase, the user has the opportunity to test the models. In the testing phase, the system decides whether an entered signature is original or fake."
