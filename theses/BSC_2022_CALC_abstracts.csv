Bereczki Arnold,"AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION OF BRAIN TESTS FROM
MULTISPECTRAL RMN VOLUMETRIC DATA","Nowadays medical image processing is a dynamically evolving science and industry. The
rapid development of computers makes it possible to implement increasingly complex
procedures. However, it is also possible for the computer to trigger the more tedious part of a
human expert’s work and enable the doctor to focus only on cases where the computer has
found something abnormal or suspicious. With this thesis, I also want to follow this trend. I
propose to implement a machine learning procedure that can efficiently and accurately
segment brain tissues based on MRI scans of six-month-old infants.
During the implementation, I worked with the data published at the iSeg-2017 competition.
From the OpenCV machine learning library, I found the discrete AdaBoost classifier to be the
most suitable for segmentation, and I added a post-processing to improve the results of the
classifier. In addition, I implemented software with a graphical user interface that can be used
to launch segmentation tasks, visualize the results, and manage the inventory of performed
operations. The average accuracy of the implemented segmentation procedure was slightly
above 85%."
Csorvasi Endre,Inventory application,"The paper is about a web application that provides a solution for companies in the
complex task of inventory management.
Nowadays, for every kind of task, there is an object or tool that helps to perform this
task, thus simplifying people's lives. The use of objects, tools has also become common
within companies, as it has allowed them to increase productivity. Because of the many
objects used, keeping track of them has become an increasing challenge for companies.
Due to the virus situation, a large number of companies have given employees the
opportunity to work remotely .
To address these problems, I have created a web application that allows companies to
easily keep track of which objects are in the possession of an employee. The application
should be available to users in multiple roles. The administrator, who is responsible for the
application, whose job is to manage objects, users and user requests. Users are the employees
who can view the objects and request the tools they need. These requests can be accepted or
rejected by the administrators.
Thanks to the web application , it is easy to access and does not need to be configured
for each employee. All you need to access it is the Internet and a web browser."
Deak Adrienn,Remote control of industrial robots with Android app,"Nowadays, IoT (Internet Of Things) technology-based systems are gaining more ground,
enabling the efficient remote control, monitoring, and management of industrial processes
with smart device applications. In the case of industrial software running on smart
devices, reliable monitoring, rapid intervention, and proper management of the access
control are critical. Hence, this kind of application development is a complex process.
Industrial robots have their own control devices to program and monitor, but these tools
are usually immovable. Therefore, in addition to these devices, mobile phone applications
can effectively serve as an extension.
This work aims to develop an open-source Android application that can be used to
remotely control robots used in the industry. The developed application can monitor
the motion of the robot based on video and sensor informations, it can send commands
and control scripts to the robot, and it ensures the manual control of the robot based on
video information. In addition to the aforementioned functionalities, the application can
analyze the remote control technique of the users. This module can help to evaluate and
educate manual robot control techniques."
Demeny Szekely Adorjan,AUTOMATIC TESTING AND UPDATING OF THE NOMINATIM SERVER,"Nowadays, geopositioning can be done on even the smallest devices, such as a smart
watch or a smart phone. Each of the GPS applications uses the reverse geocoding feature of the
map application to give the user accurate information about their location. To be able to do this,
the map application must be backed by a serious database that stores geographic data for millions
of points around the world.
There are many applications that can provide very accurate map data to users. The most known
applications are Google Maps, Bing Maps, Apple Maps, and the open source OpenStreetMap.
One of the great advantages of OpenStreetMap is that it is open source, but it is also one of it’s
weaknesses, because being open source, anyone can update the data in its database.
OpenStreetMap allows for local installation through software called Nominatim, this means that
companies can become independent from big companies who provide Map APIs for huge
amount of money. Installing such a server requires a huge amount of disk space, and the amount
of data continues to grow after installation due to updates.
The aim of this dissertation is to develop a software system that allows the Nominatim
web server data to be updated automatically, but also allows the user to manage the update
process. The software system consists of two main components, a web application that tests the
data. A server collection that allows you to update the data in the database. The web application
is an ASP.NET Core application implemented with an MVC architectural pattern. This testing
application allows the user to test the differences between two Nominatim servers. The server
collection consists of three ubuntu servers with Nominatim software installed. Their job is to
update the data in the database."
Erdos Jozsef,RESTAURANT FOOD ORDERING MOBILE APP,"The new innovations of the 21st century are making our daily lives easier, one of them
being food ordering apps, which were mainly used during the quarantine period in our region.
In my thesis, I will compare several food ordering apps, their usage, and I will also present an
application developed by me, that has been in real use for more than three months in the
villages near Odorheiu Secuiesc, Cristuru Secuiesc and Gheorgheni.
I used several technologies to create the application. The restaurant's internal system
was written in Node.js/Express.js. The API that serves the mobile app was written in Node.js
and finally for the mobile application I used React Native.
In my thesis I will present in detail how the application works and how to use it. It is
important to mention that I wanted to create a user interface by using the knowledge I gained
at the university, which provides a ready-to-use system for the users, that is rather simple and
easy to use. Another interesting aspect is that I made the application available in small
villages where online food ordering was not yet available."
Gyorfi Endre,APIAapp - Mobile application to manage farmers' subsidies,"Romania receives a large amount of money from the European Union to support farmers involved
in agri-environmental and agricultural production. The brainchild of the project is the Milvus associa-
tion, which is involved in nature conservation research. They have observed that farmers have a big
problem in obtaining information on subsidies, as there is currently no single website or application in
Romania that collects subsidies and related information. To solve this problem, the APIA APP project
was created, which consists of an Android application and a content management system.
The aim of the application is to help local farmers to browse the subsidies available in Romania
and to comply with the conditions attached to the subsidies. It also helps to follow the conditions of
the subsidies already won. It helps farmers to win a grant by collecting the documents needed to win
each grant. The development was done in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, which supports multiplatform
application development, the Android part was written in Kotlin.
The thesis describes the client and server application, the technologies used for its implementation,
covering the architecture and the functionalities. Two persons participated in the development of the application, namely Endre Györfi and István-
Lehel Balázs. The development has been divided according to functionalities, which can be followed in detail in the use-case diagram presented in the thesis."
Kencse Szabolcs,uSochool – The digital catalogue,"The world is moving fast towards digitalization by taking huge steps in all areas of life and thus
almost every person has now a smartphone. Nowadays, there are plenty of applications to facilitate
our everyday tasks, however, in one of the most important areas, education, we still do not take
advantage of the opportunities offered by these tools.
The goal of my dissertation is to provide an alternative to the handwritten catalogue used in public
education that makes it easy for all teachers, students, and parents to track student marks and
absences and helps optimizing administration processes. A teacher can hold the catalogue of all
the classes he teaches in his hand at the same time and note their grades at any time, as the physical
limit, given by the fact that there is only one unique piece for each class, is eliminated. The students
will also have the opportunity to view their marks and absences at any time without interrupting
the classes and parents will be able to keep track of real data through their kid’s user as well.
To implement this solution, I created a multiplatform application that is compatible with
smartphones running iOS and Android, but also any device that has a web browser."
Kis Gerlinda Boglarka,Graphical simulation of thermal models of buildings,"In today's digital world, modern remote controlled devices have also appeared in our homes.
These devices ensure the safety of our homes, we can monitor various household appliances
remotely and parameterize the comfort functions of our home.
The aim of this thesis is to design a universal graphical interface which can visualize the thermal
parameters of a given building, the control of the of the buildings furnace is parameterizable and
real-time feedback off the processes can be read from the interface.
The tunable parameters necessary for the mathematical model of the control algorithm can be
entered by the user through a proprietary user interface, where the user can choose the type of wall
material, and also specify other parameters (windows, doors, number of heaters) that are stored in
a database running on an external server. The user interface uses the TCP network communication
protocol to communicate with the control system. The calculated control signals can be displayed
in the user interface, and at the same time the thermal heat map of the building is also displayed.
Within the framework of the thesis, the user interface was implemented, which is able to establish
communication with a working temperature control system, the interface provides the possibility
for parameterization of the specified building, and to simultaneously assign changing heat map
and control options to the given building.
With the help of the user interface, the user can display and parameterize various control
algorithms and choose the most optimal one, thereby saving energy."
Kollo Zsolt,Timekeeping software system based on microservices,"Nowadays, cloud services are one of the most common IT services. It can be observed
that various international IT companies strive to release their own cloud services, be it
a hosting service, a database service or even a virtual server. The great advantage of
these services is that the cloud hides from developers the infrastructure necessary for the
operation of a particular system, thereby taking over responsibility from the developers.
However, its advantages also include the fact that the user can keep their data safe and
can access it from anywhere.
The AZORA system, presented in this work, is an application that allows employees of
a particular company to record the time spent on each project and task and to provide
administrative staff with a complete and comprehensive picture of the activity within
that organization. The system is based on a microservice architecture, from which the
present work focuses on the implementation of the service responsible for the registration
of hours.
The app is fully powered by Microsoft Azure cloud services. This assumes that the
application is serverless by which the cloud provider automatically deploys, scales, and
manages the infrastructure required to run the code."
Lukacs Botond,TESTER DE COMPONENTE ELECTRONICE,"In today’s world microcontroller system can be found in a lot of things and they have a big processing
capacity and can be used generally in a lot of different applications. They have a lot of functions, from
making a LED blink to automating complex systems. They also can be easily connected to external
components so this way they can be used in more ways.
For this cause this dissertation main goal it making a system which will be able to identify simple
electoronic components whith their aproximative values and their pinouts. In electoronics there are
a lot of electronic components, like resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors. But when building
a circuit it is good to know what is the component and their pinout, which is more important on
semiconductors. In a lot of times the identifier values are unreadable or there is no datasheet avabile
so it is hard to idnetify the component. For this purpose the ""electronic component teszter"" was made
which automaticall identif and outputs the component values or outputs if if failed to identify the
component. The process if fully automatic, only the component need to be connected to the tester
socket and togle switch or it automatically starts when it is connected to power.

The dissertation will cover microcontroller applications and their design for component recogniti-
on and measurement."
Lukacs Orsolya,BHEW - Be Healthy Eat Wisely,"Today, smartphones make most of our lives easier, as they allow us to access
services that embrace our day-to-day operations. These services are available through
a downloadable application, a website created by a specialized company. In many
cases, software can save energy and time. The need to manage time can also be
observed in the case of services that put our health and well-being first.
As part of my dissertation, I am developing a software that provides health
services. Important information is that the software is actually on-demand, serving a
Client. The Client's job is to advise on diet, to work as a dietitian in which she can use
the software. The implemented application, which allows the monitoring of clients,
the creation of recipes and diets, was created with the help of Flutter. We use the
real-time database provided by Firebase to store the data. The application is also
available to patients, where they can follow their diet, monitor their changes in body
size, and schedule appointments with their dietitian. The primary basis of the software
was to minimize the number of applications required to be used in the work of a
dietitian. Similar applications have been observed, as well as different parameters that
need to be considered when developing a medical application.
The Client also took part in the complete development of the software, and her
comments and needs were taken into account. The application is a version of the
expected software, for which there are still some development ideas, but for now, it
fully covers the main functionalities."
Madaras Ervin,Automatic recognition of PAL tiles,"The project aims to develop software for a wood processing company that can recognise
PAL boards by identifying and comparing different properties. This software will help the
operator of an automated crane to avoid cases where, due to human error, the supplier sends the
wrong type of PAL plate, or where, due to the same error, the woodworking company has
ordered the wrong type of PAL plate. These mistakes can lead to PAL boards, because of a
different type than the one set for the automated crane, being sent to the wrong place in the
warehouse or even the wrong type of board being processed.
The wood processing plant provided data with images of the PAL plates, and from this,
two classification algorithms were implemented. Since only one image sample of each PAL plate
exists in the database, traditional classifiers based on artificial intelligence cannot be used. For
this reason, the two algorithms that have been implemented extract features from each image and
use these features to compare the input sample with the images in the database for comparison.
One of these methods, which has been implemented, determines the dominant colors of
the images by clustering. By comparing dominant colors, the algorithm is able to determine how
similar two images are to each other. By calculating the Euclidean distance between the
dominant colors, it can give a value for how different the two images are from each other,
obviously the smaller the distance, the more similar the images are.
Another method that has been implemented is to split the images into segments and then
compute a histogram for each segment. These histograms are then concatenated to create a
feature vector for the images. It then compares the feature vectors using chi-square distance.
The conclusions are that the algorithms are sensitive to rotation. However, nice results
will be obtained if a segment of the images is created, or only one dominant color is selected and
compared."
Mihaly Elod,Optimizing brain tumor segmentation from MRI data using intelligent post-processing,"Nowadays, imaging devices deployed in medical clinical practice are producing more and more
imaging. Processing this data would require an ever-increasing number of human professionals.
As human resource training is a slow and costly process, there is an increasing need to create
an algorithm base that processes the daily acquired imagery in reliable quality and brings up to
the physician only images in which a lesion is detected or suspected to be significant.

The present thesis also aims to contribute to this algorithm base with a solution that
allows to improve the accuracy of tumor segmentation from brain MRI images. Instead of the
morphological post-processing step of an existing brain tumor segmentation procedure, an
intelligent algorithm is proposed that achieves its goal using a random forest classifier.

Experimental results have shown that the proposed method makes post-processing 18%

more accurate by replacing the original morphological post-processing with intelligent post-
processing, which reclassifies pixels based on ten morphological features extracted from planar

and spatial neighborhoods, thus making the final segmentation result more accurate."
Nagy Andrea,Brain Computer Interface (BCI) with artificial intelligence and EEG signal recognition,"The primary aim of the dissertation is to study the electrical activity of the brain, namely
the EEG-type signals and to automatically recognize specific emotions. This requires sampled
data collection and I used “Muse 2” headband in order to sample and collect this data. It was
asked a woman and a man for the data collection and both of them made the same experiment.
I processed the raw data, then I used it to build and teach an artificial neural network, which
was created with the help of Tensorflow and Keras frameworks.
The secondary aim of the dissertation is to examine the spectrum of the samples and
apply different transformations, then to compare them. Based on previous research I examined
the processing of continuous and discrete signals and placed more emphasis on discrete
transformations.
Based on my results (70-80% recognition efficiency), in order for the neural network
to be as accurate as possible, it is necessary to collect more data, classify them into classes by
providing them in a more optimal way. To reach this goal, in the future I would like to develop
a set of rules from the collected data and to classify my data based on these rules, and so I hope
to achieve greater recognition efficiency."
Rozsnyai Arnold Robert,Statistical processing of vehicle routes,"In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in demand for vehicles equipped with
GPS. As it becomes an increasing priority for people to get from one point to another as
smoothly as possible, it can be beneficial to be able to filter out the busier road sections. It can be
helpful for the vehicle owner to know as much retrievable information about the vehicle as
possible based on the route taken.

The aim of the dissertation is to process the routes of the vehicles in such a way that
conclusions can be drawn from them, with the help of which relevant data (average speed, curve
coordinates) can be filtered out. The available data set is made up of different data (coordinate,
speed, consumption, direction). The developed algorithm can be used to reduce the data set
without losing statistically important data.

The most important data contains the coordinates that result in a route change. The
solution is able to detect bends from which it can generate significant statistics (average speed in
a curve). As a result, it is able to compare different routes and suggest new ones.

The development takes place in ASP.NET Core Web App and is tested in xUnit, in which
map elements are displayed using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap."
Siko Zsolt Robert,Comparative study of supervised learning classification methods applied in medical image segmentation,"Along with the science of medicine, computer technology can be considered a
unique technology, however, the last one is experiencing a very rapid development, with the
emergence of more useful and newer information systems.
The importance of information technology in medicine can not be ignored, because of its
rapid development and a conscientious orientation, which offers a significant help in the
field of medicine.
Invented in the 1970s, the MRI scanner makes it possible to safely examine the human body
without any surgery. The so-called MRI images are made, they are investigated, nowadays
being segmented with the help of algorithms.
My paper approaches a segmentation system, the aim being to test seven different
algorithms, so that the mentioned algorithms will learn from the data provided by the babies'
brains, then they make segmentation and reach an accuracy of over 80%.
Coordination is done on a graphics user platform, so that, in order to test the system, the user
can give arbitrary parameters for the chosen algorithm.
Based on the tests, we found that among the tested methods, the AdaBoost and
Random Forest algorithms showed the best performance and along with the appropriate
settings they obtained an accuracy of about 83-84%"
Szalma Tamas Zsolt,Scalable webshop based on Kubernetes,"In today’s world, websites have to meet more and more expectations, serving an increasing
number of users is one of the most important aspects of modern websites. A page may be
browsed by 100 people in one minute and increase to 100,000 in the next minute. A modern
website needs to sense this and increase or decrease the resources allocated, depending on the
load.
The dissertation presents a scalable web application based on Kubernetes, during the creation of
which I created a webshop, and then I containerized it and deployed it to a local Kubernetes
cluster.
The webshop allows you to browse and search for products belonging to different categories,
display a specific product in detail, add products to the cart, register, login and pay by credit
card.
I used Spring Boot framework for the server side of the application. On the client side I used the
Angular framework. For the database I used a relational MySQL database.
To implement the containerization, I used Docker to create the containers that are the basis for
deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster. I solved the deployment to the Kubernetes
cluster with Minikube, which allowed me to use Kubernetes locally for free.
In the dissertation I write in detail about the technologies used, mainly about Kubernetes and
Docker, the implementation of functions, the architecture and the results achieved."
