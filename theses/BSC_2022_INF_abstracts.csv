Kezdi Ors Sebestyen,Datapack creation in Minecraft," Minecraft is a sandbox game with a significant player base. It has enjoyed undisputed popularity since its establishment more than 10 years ago. Minecraft is now one of the most played games, joining the ranks of iconic games together with the likes of Tetris. It has managed to continuously reinvent itself, keeping generations engaged to this day. Minecraft is offered on all major platforms in multiple variations to suit the needs of everyone. It can even be considered a viable educational tool, and in recognition of this, an Educational Edition is also provided.

Given the game's capabilities, one of the major classes of players is the creators. Creators, for the entertainment of their fellow players and their own, take the keyboard to enrich the community with their unique creations. One way to achieve this is by creating so-called datapacks. Datapacks offer a native way of adding new mechanics, providing modifications ranging from quality of life improvements through new challenges all the way to complete overhauls of the base mechanics of the game.

This thesis offers an overview with practical examples of datapacks, providing a starting point for the reader to begin their journey in datapacks. Creating a datapack challenges the mental faculties as much as classical programming and creativity as much as arts. This thesis describes the evolution of datapacks, offering some context for them and explaining the related game mechanics.

The technical assistance section of this thesis provides some background technical knowledge required to better understand the following sections of the thesis. Following this, a walkthrough is provided describing the creation of a datapack in a practical manner from scratch. This part also demonstrates original contributions, implementations, and related techniques.

Recursion is presented via exponentiation by squaring. Additionally, this thesis presents Random Number Generation and Object-Oriented Programming, such as handling of variables."
Elekes Rebeka,AlgoRhythmics testing module," The topic of my thesis is the further development of the AlgoRhythmics environment, with a module that allows testing the information obtained within the environment. Since the AlgoRhythmics environment is also used to develop computational thinking, it is not only able to test the information about algorithms, but also to test the development of computational thinking, thanks to this module.

In previous research, when measuring students’ performance, separate testing applications were used. To do this, students who participated in the research had to navigate from the AlgoRhythmics site to another site, register there and then complete a test consisting of different questions.

To improve the user experience and to help teachers simplify testing within the environment and make it easier to conduct research, the idea of an embeddable module was born. I felt it was important to create a module that was easy to use and that would facilitate the work of teachers using the environment.

At the same time, an important criterion was to create a competitive module with all the functionality that was available in testing interfaces used so far. With the completed module, I was also able to create a research in which I tested the development of computational thinking through metaphors. This research was the first to be done with this module within the environment framework."
Csaszar Akos,Testing JavaScript frameworks in a web environment," Nowadays, users visit more than 100 different websites each day. Ninety-eight percent of these websites are developed using JavaScript, making it indispensable in the world of web development. This thesis aims to test multiple JavaScript Frameworks in the web environment. These frameworks play an important role for web developers, whether they want to create a simple or more advanced website; it will make the development process a lot easier. In this research, we provide a comprehensive overview of JavaScript Frameworks. Next, we examine the three most used ones to highlight the advantages and limitations of each of them. After analyzing the biggest software development portals, the three most used frameworks today are Angular, React, and Vue. The comparison first was done on a theoretical basis, followed by a more practical one by creating a website that used all three technologies. The conclusion is that each framework has its strengths, and the usage should depend on the context and the purpose of the website."
Tasnadi Istvan Norbert,Application of the A* algorithm in video games," Using computers is now an integral part of our lives, and we use them for many things. Whether it's to do our work at work or at home as a recreational tool, such as browsing the web, listening to music, watching a film, or even playing games. Video games have gained immense popularity over the last decade. People like to sit down and play a game in their free time, either with friends or against a computer. The computer is expected to be as natural and smart as possible, making the game more enjoyable. As it can also provide a challenge to the user. This is why many game development companies are trying to put more advanced and smarter artificial intelligence into their games.

The aim of my thesis is to create an artificial intelligence for a 2D platformer game that can entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior. By complex behavior, we mean the following: if the opponent has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, the opponent should patrol. If the opponent has noticed the player, then the opponent should chase the player or attack the player if they are close enough.

To increase the intelligence of the AI, the A\* path search algorithm will play a major role. This will optimally determine the shortest route between the player and the opponent. The opponent will chase the user-controlled character along that route.

To implement the game, we used the Unity game engine. We also loaded the A\* Pathfinding Project plugin to apply the A\* pathfinding algorithm."
Gabor Anita Renata,The problem of graph coloring in a genetic approach," The main topic of my dissertation is the use of genetic algorithms to solve a classical problem. As we know, almost every living thing in the world around us can be traced to Darwin's theory of evolution. A similar computer program can be designed for this process, resulting in the production of different ""individuals"" as a result of genetic processes.

There are situations in life where it is important to get the best results not only accurately but also quickly. In these cases, it can be very important which algorithm you choose to solve the problem. The focus of my case study is the problem of graph coloring, which is still a relatively unknown field in the programming world.

For my research, I am looking for an answer to the question of how worthwhile it is to use genetic algorithms to obtain a better solution than a given one. In the meantime, I have listed several aspects for my proof. For instance, what is the difference between a classical solution and a genetic solution for a given task? Or, what happens if the initial population is less than the number of generations we will get as a result, or vice versa? Or, what if we increase or decrease the number of colors? What effect will this have on the effectiveness of a good coloring? The number of edges or nodes?

I ran the survey on a self-designed software for 100 randomly generated graphs. The tests were repeated, and I calculated averages to make the results even more valid. Finally, I compared and evaluated the results. By the end of my research, based on the results, we will draw conclusions as to why it is suitable to use a genetic algorithm. We can also delve into the problem of graph coloring in more depth."
Somai Norbert-Attila,Football Lobby: Mobile app for organizing football matches," The aim of my thesis is to make it easier and faster to organize and search for soccer matches using an Android application. It has happened to many of us that we would have liked to go out to play football in the afternoon, after school, university, or work, but it takes a lot of time to ask all your friends if they can and do want to join. Often it is only after a lot of wasted time that it turns out that you end up failing to gather the right number of players, so unfortunately the game is missed.

A solution to these problems is provided by the project, which implements a user-friendly and efficient Android application. This allows us to create a football match waiting room after registration, with a specified location and time where and when we want to play. You can add friends to this, search for other players and invite them to join and play with you.

If you don’t want to create your own game, you can search for the right one for you and join. Furthermore, the implemented software provides an opportunity to chat with other users, privately or at room level. After the game is over, we can rate the participating players according to different criteria. These ratings help us find the right players for our team.

Everyone prefers to play with someone who has very good ratings and a lot of positive feedback from previous games, even if we don’t know that person, rather than someone with bad ratings. The app also notifies users of any major events, guaranteeing that it won’t go unnoticed if someone sends you a message, a friend request, wants to join one of our lobbies, or we simply need to rate our teammates after a game is over."
Kovács Andrea,Mouse dynamics-based bot detection," Nowadays, bot detection is gaining more and more attention due to the damage caused by bots, besides the fact that they perform automated tasks. Although the presence of bots is being examined from more and more aspects to prevent attacks, it is a complex process as state-of-the-art bots are already aimed at mimicking human behavior. In my research, I examine the human-like behavior of bots in terms of different generated mouse movements. I generated synthetic data sets based on different parameterized versions of Bézier curves and also by a generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) specialized in time series. I performed feature extraction on raw data sets, which resulted in a total of 29 features. I had access to the Sapimouse data set, which contains mouse dynamics data for 120 users. Using this data set and the synthetic data sets, I measured the performance of different detectors. The best performing detector, which proved to be the most successful in distinguishing between generated and real human mouse movements, was the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), achieving values above 0.81 for 1 mouse movement and above 0.96 for 10 mouse movements in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric. The research part was followed by the development of a software that illustrates single mouse movement-based bot detection."
Demeny Zsofia,Anomaly detection for password typing," These days, the security and maintenance of IT systems are very important. To access these systems' functionalities, authentication is required. Authentication makes it possible for users with the appropriate rights to access sensitive data. Authentication can be performed in various ways, one of which is biometrics - the measurement of characteristics related to life processes. Authentication systems can be divided into two categories: 1) access-based authentication and 2) continuous authentication.

In my dissertation, I studied keystroke rhythm in the case of password typing, which is an authentication method based on behavioral biometrics. Typing rhythm refers to the speed at which a person writes or types. This characteristic is suitable for identifying and authenticating a person. I divided the research into two major parts:

1. In the first part, I examined which is the best performing anomaly detector in the world of typing rhythms. Here, I used the PyOD package and studied the detectors in it.
2. The second half of the research was closely related to the first. I studied how I could compare the performance and illustrate the results of the measurements made. This is how the website component was born, which illustrates the measurements, summarizes, and highlights the important information. It has a teaching, didactic character.

All software created as part of this research is publicly available on GitHub."
Kecskes Kerestely David Attila,"Reconstructer, the centralized platform for craftsman and their materials"," The aim of my bachelor thesis is to build an application that offers an online platform for:

1. Reselling old, not used building materials
2. A place for people who need a craftsman for their construction projects
3. A place for craftsmen to showcase their works

The application will also serve as a viewing tool for craftsmen to visualize their bookings and works that need to be done. I aim to address issues that arise in our lives when it comes to building or repairing things around us. By paying attention to our surroundings, we can notice a lot of buildings and constructions happening near us, from our homes to the streets we walk on every day, to offices and universities.

When dealing with such situations, we often require equipment, construction materials, and people who work in construction. In my thesis, I am looking for solutions to two major problems:

1. The unused items that are lying around in our houses without any purpose. Shops that sold those items cannot take them back, so they could be reused by other people.
2. The lack of people in construction, specifically craftsmen. Their contacts are hard to find, and there is currently no centralized platform where you can easily locate them."
Sipos Erno,Water surface analysis based on satellite images on Android," The topic of my thesis is the presentation, development, and implementation of the algorithm I wrote. The main objective of this algorithm is to study satellite images received from NASA and to highlight variations in the ratio of these images. I ran the algorithm under the Android operating system, which has the advantage of fast and efficient processing of large images, using a RenderScript. The images represent climate change within a given area over a certain time interval. The software was implemented in several ways, improving its efficiency step by step. The two major stages of the process are presented in this thesis: running the algorithm on CPU and GPU, considering their advantages and disadvantages. The goal is to process images pixel by pixel and perform segmentation using the information stored in them, as mentioned above. Throughout the ongoing and detailed research, several stages of the algorithm will be described, tracking all stages of development from the initial form of the algorithm up to the final version. I will divide the algorithm and software into two stages and examine them: the existing software and algorithms, as opposed to the algorithm I have written."
Dragos Norbert Janos,"""Mouse in the maze"": specific graph theory aspects"," The subject of my thesis is ""Mouse in the Maze"": specific graph theory aspects. These aspects being illustrated in an open source desktop application. In education, we can name various methods of teaching a subject, be it in theory, in diagrams or even practice. The scope of my application is to open up a new possibility to teach and learn graph theory. The aspects of graph theory get showcased in a game desert application, a game called CheeseChaser. By using the concept of gamification, we can illustrate these theories in an engaging way.

By the time of writing my thesis, the application holds functionalities like changing some of the options in the options menu, exiting the application or even starting a game where the user controls the mouse character. The mouse has to reach the goal, the cheese, to win the game, navigating through the maze populated by hostile cats. The number of cats depends on the selected map, and their pathfinding illustrates the graph theory."
Szilveszter David,Parameter identification in mathematical modelling using differential equations," Mathematical modeling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding, quantifying the impact of different changes on a system, and can also help to make tactical and strategic decisions.

Models can be classified according to different aspects. Depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models. They can also be classified as classical or structural models.

To choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete. The modeling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, analysis, testing, and application.

Problems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated.

Mathematical modeling came to the fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gauss, and A.J. Nicholson.

In my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the specified model: the integral method, the log-integral method, where I will use the Lotka-Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species; and finally, I will try to improve the results by particle swarm optimization. I will compare the results with solutions from an advanced software package incorporating artificial intelligence."
Kovacs Norbert,Officers on the chessboard," Nowadays we meet a lot of logic games in each of the corners of the online space, which we use with pleasure, irrespective of sex and age. Although young people are using these games the most, middle-aged and old people also play them with pleasure. For example: chess, mill, backgammon, and so on. Many want to develop competitively, but most persons play logic games for pleasure. The main purpose of logic games is the development of intellectual abilities and the useful and valuable use of free time. My goal in this work is to create software that includes a logic game. The basis of this logic game is a chess table. The essence of the game is that the player must place as many selected chess pieces as possible on the table without having them hit one another, following the rules of each figure's movements. The size of the chess table and the figures used on it can be chosen by the user. Using this software corresponds to educational purposes as well, with a professor mode that presents the correct solutions in informatics defined through the backtracking mode. To create this application, I used the programming language C++, and the user interface I realized using the Qt frame system application. This logic game offers pleasant time spent for anyone who knows the rules of figure hitting. Continuously, for students studying informatics at our university, it is an application for visualizing the backtracking mode."
Fulop Zoltan,Movie watching habits tracker," The topic of my thesis was to create a website that allows users to track and rate movies and series they watch, and to generate various reports from this data. In addition, the user is given the opportunity to receive further recommendations based on the movies and series they have viewed. To build the user interface, I used the open-source library React, which is written in JavaScript. React applications are built from separate components. With this approach, I was able to develop more complex interactive applications, benefiting from the state management provided by the library. To manage users, I used the authorization service provided by Firebase. In addition, I handled other data using the Firestore system provided by Firebase. At the heart of this system is a NoSQL database, which provides cloud access and data management. The data for movies and series is provided by HTTP requests to a RESTful service. This service is none other than TheTVDB. In the next part of my thesis, I will discuss in detail how I implemented this system, providing a detailed explanation of all its functionalities."
Timar Mate Adam,Mobile application for shopping canvas paintings," Online shopping is flourishing today, as on one hand a wide range of online platforms, applications and web shops offer users a convenient way to do their shopping. On the other hand, the coronavirus has forced people to do their purchases online. However, experience shows that the online shopping trend has continued after the epidemic situation subsided. The focus of my thesis is the online sale and purchase of products, using a mobile application I have developed. This application provides an excellent solution for the online purchase of wall pictures for home decoration purposes. It satisfies several aspects of the most important needs of the customers.

The app is easy to use, but at the same time it offers users several options that make it easier for them to select and buy products. After a quick registration, prospective customers can browse through the products. If they find a product they like, they can request additional information as well as add it to their shopping cart.

The final list of products from the cart and their price can be viewed, and users can finalize the order. After filling in the address, they can expect to receive the product that will be delivered to them shortly. Registered users can give feedback on products by rating them or adding reviews. This information is visible to everyone, so that customers can help each other in choosing the right product.

The web shop admin can upload new products, attaching photos for illustrative purposes. But even the admin cannot delete or edit the customers’ reviews. This can only be done by the user who added the review to the certain product, thus ensuring that the reviews remain authentic and objective. The admin’s main task is to view all orders placed by customers, including the details required for delivery.

My project’s target group consists of users who intend to purchase home furnishing products online. My interface meets the needs of both buyers and distributors and provides users with a convenient and reliable way to shop online. In my thesis, I will also discuss the .NET and Android frameworks, the technologies associated with these frameworks, and a detailed description of my project from a programming perspective."
Szakacs David,Web end-to-end testing system," The subject of my thesis is the creation of an application that makes it possible to test web pages with ease using a graphical interface. The objective is to make it easy for users to test the correct behavior of their websites without requiring them to learn new testing libraries.

The application enables users to implement end-to-end web tests in just a few minutes. I managed to implement a product that makes the web testing process 90% faster and 70% cheaper than the most used products on the market.

The application is built based on a Software-as-a-Service model. The product is not the graphical interface itself, but the automated testing system behind it. The sole purpose of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is to create a better user experience and make the application available and usable for a larger audience.

The graphical interface is a desktop application implemented using Electron, a technology that embeds a website inside a desktop software. This can be installed and used on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. By doing this, we can have a product with high cross-platform compatibility and the ability to test local websites at the same time.

The application communicates with a server, which is responsible for project and user data management. This way, users can have the same exact experience from any device they access the application from. The server-side application is written in TypeScript using the Express.js framework inside Node.js. The client-side application was created using Electron, which embeds a Next.js website written in TypeScript into itself.

Apart from the above-mentioned technologies, both applications use third-party libraries and tools. In my thesis, I go into detail about the problems in the IT sector that I'm trying to fix with my application. I also talk about the direction that the application needs to be developed towards so it can become an industry standard with time."
Mihaly Bence,Image segmentation with the help of U-net," Nowadays, thanks to the development of machine learning, machine learning is more frequently used to analyze images. The U-Net is such a convolutional neural network that was primarily developed for accurate image segmentation of biological images. The success of U-Net is demonstrated by its widespread use, ranging from CT and MRI scans to vehicle detection. In my thesis, I seek answers to the question: ""Which parameters could achieve the most accurate image segmentation on a given dataset?""

Accurate image segmentation might help in all sorts of fields and could potentially save lives, for instance, on a CT scan, if it can detect and identify an abnormality of a tissue. During the research, we save models with different kinds of parameters to compare and evaluate the differences between these models. The examined architecture with the best parameter settings results in at least 97% classification accuracy and is able to detect parts of the images. Thus, the model provides some really good results.

Since U-Net is a new approach to image segmentation, it may be worthwhile to try several parameter settings that could lead to an even more accurate image segmentation architecture."
Bedo Laszlo,GyMate application: useful mate in the gym," The topic of my dissertation is the creation of an android application that serves as a companion in the classroom and helps students perform exercises. In my present dissertation, I tried to find an answer to the question of what shortcomings characterize applications with similar themes, and which aspects require development. To achieve my goal, I conducted a questionnaire survey among people who regularly go to the gym or use similar apps, focusing on the question of what features users are missing or suggesting from these apps. In addition, I have reviewed several applications myself and tried to assess which features are usually missing from these.

The results of my survey and the answers given in the questionnaire agree that the main issues with most of these applications were the lack of personalization, the lack of personal training plans, and the need for monitoring and logging. Based on these results, I tried to correct these shortcomings in my dissertation. I designed my app to help users with these things, making it transparent, easy to use, and customizable."
Berszan Robert,Similarity metrics in image recognition," In my thesis, I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays, there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations.

Recent innovations rely frequently on image recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication, and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture's pixel values, we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas.

In order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy, this can lead to image recognition.

In order to achieve this, there is a need for the development of fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms. In this work, I am comparing different distance metrics for the computation of similarities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan, and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images.

In all the cases, I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-written digits and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean, and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies.

I will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing distance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). At the conference, I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of the technology."
Nagy Hunor Zalan,Application of machine learning methods for the segmentation of infant brain tissues based on multi-spectral MRI data," Nowadays, in our fast-developing world, more and more medical imaging instruments are producing an exponentially growing amount of image data. The processing of this kind of data requires highly qualified medical staff, whose training would be very expensive for the system. So, there is an urgent need to train computers to perform the processing of this data and present those records to the medical staff, which are suspected of containing lesions or some kind of special patterns.

The aim of my dissertation is to find the most suitable machine learning algorithm to accurately and efficiently segment the brain tissues of six-month-old infants from volumetric MRI data. A framework was created in which seven machine learning methods can be deployed to process the ten brain MRI records of the iSeg-2017 database. In each case, training is performed using nine records, and tested on the tenth one.

The implemented segmentation methods rely on the OpenCV Machine Learning library. A graphical user interface was created to set the parameters of each algorithm, which can call an external console application to perform the segmentation. Several such applications can run in parallel mode.

For the evaluation of the segmentation’s result, statistical methods were employed. The framework was written in C# programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio environment.

From the investigated machine learning algorithms, the best result came from the discrete AdaBoost, with slightly above 84% of accuracy, which was tightly followed by Random Forest. In efficiency, the KNN algorithm isn’t competitive, but in case of training with tiny sized learning data, it can produce similar accuracy to the above-mentioned algorithms."
Fechita Catalin Francisc,Title of the Bachelor thesis FIND AND REPLACE," The aim of my thesis is to present the Find and Replace tool in a different context, which eases up the job of a developer or programming student. As we all know, nowadays every text editor software and development environment has a find & replace tool, but in almost every case, it is limited to a single opened file or project. The goal of the software written by me is to make searching and replacing in a large number of files as fast as possible. Since there are similar applications available, my focus is not only on making it fast, I also focused on implementing useful functionalities for the target mentioned above.

In this thesis, I present two other similar applications besides mine. I test the main search and replace methods in each of the applications and measure their speed of execution. I do more than one run on every method so that I can calculate their average performance, in order to get authentic results. After the tests, I will compare and evaluate the obtained results. I will not only compare the applications based on their speed because I want to highlight each one of them in the area they excel in."
Tamas Szabolcs Huba,Catalog search extension," The topic of my thesis was to create an extension. The essence of this extension is to search for a product number in the ""CATALOG SEARCH"" application, which you can select in the user's browser. This is different from what they have previously chosen.

Of course, this can also be solved by the user memorizing the product code on one page and then entering the application, entering the number, and getting the results. The problem with this is that it takes a lot more time than the plugin I created.

There are situations in life where it is important that we can solve these things not only accurately, but as quickly as possible. So, the time factor also matters. In my thesis, this goal was set for me: to make the life of application users easier and to help them achieve what they are interested in as quickly as possible.

Among the aims of the thesis, the most important advantages of the extension should be mentioned. I also covered the technologies used and thoroughly analyzed why it is worth using them. To achieve my goal, I used the internet to gain interesting data.

In this thesis, I am looking for the answer to the question of how to take advantage of the possibilities offered by extensions, where and how to store user data, and why use localStorage. I used this feature instead of a database through which I could access the application.

Only users who already have an account can use this extension."
Csép Tamás,Image Processing on Web Interface," Digital image processing has undergone an explosive development in recent decades, and it has become a part of our daily lives, even if not everyone is familiar with its basics. Digital image processing tools can be found in medical diagnostic instruments, space exploration tools, printing technology, phototechnics, industrial process control, and electronic gaming machines. Therefore, we can safely say that we use it in all areas of life, and more and more professionals will need to know about computer image processing. The topic of my dissertation is image processing on a web interface. Image processing is a method by which we can perform certain operations on an image to obtain an improved image or extract useful information from it. I have successfully implemented an application that allows users to utilize the functions of the OpenCV.js library through a user-friendly interface. During the design of the application, I ensured that the interface was user-friendly and easy for the user to navigate. In the end, I compared OpenCV's image processing functions in three different programming languages: C++, Python, and Java. The C++, Python, and Java OpenCV libraries have more functions than the JavaScript OpenCV library."
Vancza Tibor,Security of Ad blockers," The aim of the dissertation is to provide an insight into the operation of modern ad-blocking browser add-ons (Ad-blocks) and the measures taken by websites against Ad-blocks. In the dissertation, the topic is examined primarily from the point of view of data security. The dissertation will also discuss the types of advertisements, their frequency, the economic role of advertisements in modern web development, the role and necessity of Ad-block, and the future of Ad-block. The dissertation includes an Ad-block prototype Google Chrome add-on written in React (Open Source Front-end JavaScript Library for UI). The prototype is used to illustrate what is described during the theory and to deepen the specific practical experience related to the topic."
Cioma Roland Sandor,Intelligent document browser," The goal of my project is to create an application that makes digitizing documents easier. Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and institutions. My application can be used to digitize two kinds of documents: scanned paper documents and sound files. The software extracts data from each uploaded document, resulting in a computerized text file. Before saving the data from the document, it extracts entities (people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Additionally, it creates a summary of the text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text.

The other important function of the software is browsing documents. Users can search for, view, and download documents uploaded by other users. When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art software.

The software is made up of two parts: an Angular application on the client's end and a REST API on the server's end. This gives it the advantage that it can be further developed on the client's end, with a mobile application, for example."
Ivacson Ingrid,Title of the Bachelor thesis The role of the teacher in the online teaching of graph algorithms," The topic of my dissertation is ""Promoting the online teaching of graph algorithms and examining the role of the teacher in this educational environment."" The 2020-2021 school year has made a difference in everyone’s lives. COVID-19 has changed the way we live our lives. Authorities were forced to introduce decisions that limited our daily lives. Restrictions have also been introduced in the field of education, which is why face-to-face education has been replaced by an online educational environment. However, this has been to the detriment of the academic development of many students. This period has proved that online education is still in its infancy, so there is a great need to improve it. This should also be an important goal for the future, as we may need it again at any time as a result of unforeseen events.

At the same time, online learning has existed in a sense so far and has been favorably used by students. By this I mean the independent development of the learner by using different phone and web applications to better understand the curriculum. So the question would be: If there are online applications that help to acquire and deepen new knowledge, what could be the real role of the teacher in teaching? Also, how could the benefits of a teacher’s presence be assessed?

To be able to assess the possibilities, I thought programming teaching would be a subject that was closer to me and could provide a solution to that. Among programming techniques, my research is limited to examining the teaching of graph algorithms. The practical part of my dissertation was the implementation of a web application that enables students to learn and develop independently by acquiring theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as providing opportunities for teacher-led learning. At the same time, the site offers an opportunity to evaluate the development of knowledge that the teacher’s presence will bring to students.

In order to test the application and to search for answers, I conducted surveys among the first-year students of the university majoring in informatics and computer science, with a total of four groups. I also tested the effectiveness of the application and the importance of the role of the teacher. I also processed the results statistically and visualized them using diagrams that provided answers to the questions mentioned above."
Majla Nandor,Automatic Time Tracker Using Machine Learning," A Time Tracker is a system or software that keeps track of the activities the user spends their time on. Many use these for various purposes, including personal improvement and keeping track of billable hours. however, such systems rely on user input and are thus prone to user errors. Is it possible to implement time-tracking functionality without user interaction on a personal computer?

The goal of this thesis is to discuss one possible solution to this problem: collecting usage data in a method similar to that of ""keylogger"" viruses. Using this data, a neural network can be trained to place time spans spent at the computer into user-defined activity categories. This new generated data can then be the subject of further statistical analysis."
Donath Daniel Zsolt,Studying the Hungarian online press in Transylvania from language processing point of view," The theme of my paper is the study of the Transilvanian Hungarian press through language processing using different technologies. We get a ton of news and articles about events, phenomena, problems from the surrounding world. This way, the news have a tremendous role in our lives, keeping us informed about happenings in the world or around us, in the transilvanian area. With the widespread of the internet, the number of these news has grown exponentially, making it impossible to analyze and research them only with human resources. Today, the data mining industry is in an accelerated expansion through text analytics and NLP methods, as they can mine information efficiently and in a fast way from big data using half-automated methods and different algorithms. This paper will examine this subject focusing on the Transylvanian Hungarian press. We try to extract as many useful pieces of information as possible from the multitude of gathered articles with the aid of different libraries and software. Based on the extracted information, we can make statistical calculations, analyses, for example, how popular is a person during a certain period in the Transylvanian Hungarian press? Besides, we can create visuals that everyone understands and get a view of the press ""world"". I presented my dissertation at the XXI. Faculty Scientific Student Conference on April 29, 2022. There, I received praise as a result."
Kovacs Lehel,Solutions for storage tasks using the ERP system and applications," The main topic of my thesis is to help and speed up the solution of warehousing tasks. Warehousing tasks, such as inventory management, handling of outgoing and incoming goods, and even traceability of goods, are a task that requires a relatively large amount of time and human resources, which is essential for any company that supplies or distributes products. In my present thesis, I am looking for a solution to this problem as generally as possible, so that the storage needs of as many companies as possible can be met. Accurate data can be provided, and the time allocated for this can be significantly reduced.

ERP systems are designed to solve these types of problems. By putting these systems into practice and using a portable device that can communicate with them, the warehousing problem can be solved. However, the issue of generality still exists. For the sake of generality, ERP systems and the portable device that communicates directly with them should not associate data-specific reports. This does not benefit companies using ERP systems; they also need to generate reports.

To solve this problem, a third company-specific component is required. This component makes sense of the data provided by the previous components and makes it appropriate for the company."
Balogh Laszlo,Mind controlled universal remote control," One often wonders if it would be nice if some things could happen just by thinking them. Surprisingly, this technology has been around for a long time and is constantly evolving. Systems that use this technology are called Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). NextMind has taken a new approach to BCI technology with their 2020 device. Their technology measures visual field activation, stimulus, and decodes focus. The device works by adding faint graphical overlays optimized for the visual cortex to user interface elements, enabling them to be brought into focus. When such an object comes into focus, it activates and executes the commands assigned to it. In this work, we tested the feasibility, ease of use, and convenience of this new technology. For this purpose, we have created a mind-controlled universal remote control. The mind-controlled universal remote control we implemented allows the user to control smart devices at home through a graphical user interface."
Koble Melinda Andrea,A comparative study on histogram normalization of MRI records," The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be interpreted together with their context. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other. In other words, they need a normalization. The most popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al. in 2000. This method aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternatively, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with them.

This thesis proposes to investigate which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques. Which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results?

Two publicly available brain MRI data sets are involved in the investigation: one without and the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation, we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more than five milestones that represent constraints of the normalized histogram."
Pinkoczi Jozsef,OpenGL app for smartphone," The topic of my thesis is to create an application for smartphones based on OpenGL (Open Graphics Library). Open GL is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering. Open GL occurs in many places, as it is a popular tool for programmers, as they can easily draw three-dimensional shapes and control how they are drawn. Personally, I was also captivated by OpenGL because I wanted to implement an app that develops kids’ math skills, making it a memorable experience for them. Knowing these, I came to the conclusion that I would use virtual reality to create a game that would develop the math skills of first and second graders.

In today’s world, there is a strong emphasis on modernization to make things as simple, enjoyable, and fast as possible. In this thesis, I will briefly present the Unity programming platform, the Google Cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created. During the creation of the application, I encountered some errors. I will explain to you when and where I encountered those errors and finally how to eliminate them."
Nagy Krisztian Endre,Comparison of mobile software development technologies under the Android platform," The topic of my thesis is the comparison of different mobile application development technologies, which allows us to draw realistic conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies. In the world of IT, new technologies are emerging every day. This is also true in the field of mobile application development. Developers can choose to stick with the familiar native Android app development or choose one of the cross-platform development technologies. However, this choice should not be left to intuition or chance, as each of the different technologies has its advantages and disadvantages. Once you know these, you will know which technology is the most appropriate for solving a problem or implementing a project. Within the scope of this project, three music player applications with the same system specification but using different technologies will be implemented and compared. The software implemented will allow some measurements to be made on the performance of the applications, while also providing the opportunity to analyze the development process in the different technologies."
Barabasi Robert Zsolt,Android Cryptocurrency application," The topic of my thesis is the implementation of an Android application that simplifies the monitoring of cryptocurrency changes. There are already many similar applications on the commercial market, so it is very difficult to come up with something radical. The biggest problem with most applications is the overloaded user interface. Once in the hands of a market-leading application, the user spends a considerable amount of time to get to know the application well, because without a thorough knowledge of the application, it becomes hard to properly use it. It is well known that time is money, and every second is crucial when it comes to cryptocurrency applications. Prices can change in a matter of seconds, so it is not a good user experience if you lose valuable information because of the application.

My app goes radically against many apps on the market. The goal was to implement an application that would solve all the problems mentioned above. First of all, the big advantage of the application is its clean, simple user interface, which maximizes the cryptocurrency mapping without any distractions. After installation, the application is ready to use in no time and with less than ten clicks, unlike competing software, where the first few minutes are spent learning the application.

My application has an intuitive user interface, which allows the user to analyze dozens of cryptocurrencies in no time. In the case of my application, it is also possible to access critical functionality of the application on a smartwatch. The smartwatch can be used to take the user experience to a higher level by maximizing the tracking of cryptocurrency changes."
Hamza Balazs,SapiNotes," In today's world, access to information is much simpler than it was before. Instead of spending hours in the library extracting information from books, we can now download a note from the Internet which contains all the information we need. This facilitated information acquisition has made learning more optimal for people, as they can access more information in less time. To this end, I have prepared my dissertation, which provides access to important and informative notes uploaded by users for other users through a website. Every note can be linked to a subject, making the search easier. When uploading, the user needs to enter the major and subject of the note, in addition to a descriptive name, and last but not least, the note itself has to be uploaded. Then, with one click, the user can upload the note to the database, after which it will be displayed on the main page of the web application. These notes also have a rating, which lets users rate each other's notes, helping to filter out bad or weak notes. After listing, users have the option to download and view the notes. Every user can list their own notes on a separate page, where they have the option to delete the note."
Fuzi Botond,WorkGuru: Time-tracking app for group projects," The topic of my thesis is time management of group projects and increasing the efficiency of development work using a phone application. In real life, many people struggle with time management problems, both at work and in their personal lives. Constant proostitation at work, difficulties in dealing with unexpected situations or delays due to dependencies during group work. In such cases, we tend to spend more time on solving a problem rather than involving other points of view or more experienced people. Unfortunately, it is not possible to come up with a universal template to solve all these types of problems, but in many cases, we end up making the same mistake over and over again.

In general, the trinity of orderliness, good scheduling, and good communication is the key to solving the problems mentioned above. Within the scope of this project, a user-friendly and efficient Android application will be implemented that will help to organize tasks, measure work performance, and collaborate with colleagues within a work team.

By measuring the time spent on tasks in a specific way, the application is able to set up a profile that speeds up the process of unblocking tasks by giving users the possibility to perform a targeted search to find the person best suited to perform the task. A platform that puts more emphasis than its predecessors on maintaining focus and the well-being of users at work.

The implemented application allows logged-in users to create categories, projects, and tasks within a secure system, time them, and generate and view reports. The aim is primarily to assist the user’s work, not to monitor it. Their skills are also measured during the timekeeping process so that the accumulated experience is quantified to some extent. This gives credit to the accumulated experience base that the user has gathered during his measured work.

In addition, the Pomodoro technique has been introduced for time measurement, which also contributes to the user’s productivity."
Fekete Dániel,Scientific journal rankings according to categories," The topic of my paper is a user-friendly webpage that creates and shows the ratings of magazines, based on their categories, using the database and measures of Scimago Journal Rank (SJR). As it is well-known, in order to keep up with the pace of our world’s rapid development, one must be present in the digital world as well. The easiest way of achieving that is through a webpage: it is accessible and browsable for anyone, from anywhere around the world. I will present the making of the webpage step by step. First, I will discuss the methods I used to create it. Second, I will elaborate on the data utilized to create the magazines’ ratings and the technologies used to reach the website’s goals. Third, I will introduce the criteria upon which the website creates the assessment of scientific magazines. From a different perspective, we will then examine the website from both the user's and creator's point of view. Lastly, we will discuss how the website becomes accessible to everyone."
Toth Adam,Task Management Tool," The topic of my dissertation is to solve a problem faced by the fast developing humanity with the help of technology. As we know, almost everyone in the world around us needs daily pre-programming of what they need to do in order to get everything done and show up on time at every important meeting. The problem of forward planning arises due to the fact that our world is changing at a rapid pace, and we need to find a solution to see how successfully we are able to perform our daily pre-planned tasks optimally. We have reached a level where it is essential in the life of an average person to examine how effectively they perform their tasks, to what extent they are able to perform them, and whether they succeed in completing them on time. There may even be a situation where, knowing that two tasks are planned very close in time, a person may not be able to complete or show up for both, and the logical decision is to decide based on importance and priority, which one of the two tasks the person should show up for and which one they will complete. An appropriate software that can take priority into account can also help in this case. In this dissertation, I am looking for a solution to the problem of what type of software should be implemented so that a given person can monitor the effectiveness of managing and planning their day-to-day tasks to be able to develop themselves further in being more productive.

I have divided the software into two categories, and I will examine: software that already exists and can be used for task planning, and self-implemented software. In order to examine existing software, I conducted market research to gather information or find missing functionalities in existing and commonly used software, which I can integrate into my own software. My solution consists of two software applications: an android mobile application designed for data collection, task registration, and tracking, and a web application that processes the data collected by the android application for the user to increase productivity."
Kedves Norbert,Quiz empire," Nowadays, various quiz applications are becoming more and more widespread on the Internet. A quiz is a series of questions on a specific topic and form that people should try to answer correctly. This is followed by the result and score, which shows a comprehensive picture of the knowledge in the given topic. However, few applications have a main purpose of transferring information and deepening knowledge. In many cases, the only way to take part in quizzes is to join other activities. Furthermore, in addition, most topics are not well separated or precisely defined. It is also a common confounding factor that the correct answers are not shown, and the questions that appear during the quiz are always the same, in the same order. In my thesis, a quiz-focused software was implemented which provides a solution to these problems.

It matters a lot for people who would often and willingly take quizzes to do so in a friendly, unified, and simple interface where the community they create will help and support each other. To implement the interface, I created a web application with basic features that are useful, clear, and easy to manage. In the implemented application, users can not only try out existing quizzes which assess knowledge, but also expand this list by making new quizzes on their own topic.

It often happens that a quiz with the preferred theme is not found anywhere. In this case, using the ""Requests"" feature will allow people to request a quiz on the topic they want, and other users can accomplish it in the near future. After finishing a quiz, it is possible to view one's results in more detail in a PDF document, which will help memorize new information. Members can communicate with each other in many ways (forum, chat, private message), make friends, and see the opinions and the results of the quizzes."
Moldovan Adrienn,NyiltnApp: Software for Organizing Open Days," The subject of my thesis is ""Open days,"" a software that eases the organization of Open days event series, implemented as a web application which requires authentication. When organizing events, we often need different tools, software that allow us to store data entered by users in databases, through a user-friendly visual interface. The purpose of these applications is to reduce preparation time, make the work of organizers easier, and also allow those who want to participate in an event to easily communicate their intention to do so. They can choose among the many events displayed and find out details about them.

The project aims to develop software facilitating the organization of Open days at the university. In addition, it will be possible not only to collect applications but also to summarize them and visualize the data received according to various criteria. The implemented software allows connected users to view the events taking place during Open days, their dates, locations, and organizers, as well as to register and unsubscribe from them. For administrator users, it is possible to add events, along with relevant details, as well as edit and delete them."
Csegezi Balazs Csongor,Interactive Rubik’s Cube solving web application," The topic of my dissertation is an interactive web application that allows its user to solve the ""Rubik's Cube."" Within the framework of the application, we have the opportunity to scan the configuration of each side of our cube, using our webcam, to generate a series of rotations to solve the cube and illustrate it step by step with a 3D representation for the client.

One of the most popular logic games today is the Rubik's Cube. This Hungarian invention has been extremely successful worldwide since the 1980s. It is a three-dimensional logic game. The goal is simple, yet all the more challenging: to bring the cube to its original state after random shuffling, which has long been considered impossible.

Which solution we choose depends entirely on our level, how many algorithms we want to keep in mind, how fast we want to solve it, or whether we want to solve the cube blindly or with one hand?

The algorithm built into the application successfully completes the task with 22 or even fewer rotations, solving all sides of the cube thanks to Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm."
