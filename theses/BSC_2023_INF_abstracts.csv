Iuhos Imola ,OpenGL application for smartphone," The topic of my thesis is to create a smartphone application based on OpenGL. Open GL (Open Graphics Library) is a partially developed standard that covers an API allowing manage graphics cards and program two- and three-dimensional graphics through a simple, standard interface. OpenGL is a tool programming enthusiasts enjoy using because it allows almost direct control of the graphics card, three-dimensional shapes can be easily drawn, and rendering methods can be controlled.

In today’s world, people are increasingly visual; their attention is drawn to what pleases the eye, what is interesting, exciting, new, modern. We all want to gather new experiences, enrich ourselves with new knowledge and use modern technology. That's exactly why I chose OpenGL, because I wanted to implement an application that would give children a fun opportunity to assess their Bible knowledge. In addition to deepening knowledge, an important goal was to provide children with a play experience. Since children are very visual, we have found virtual reality to be the most ideal way to capture the interest of 7-12 year olds and deepen and expand their Bible knowledge. OpenGL gave me a simple, nice, and quickly implementable help to achieve my goal.

In this dissertation, I will briefly introduce the Unity programming platform, the Google Cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created."

One of the prominent applications of the Monte Carlo algorithm is in game-playing artificial intelligence. Monte Carlo algorithms are useful in AI games because they can simulate and evaluate different moves, allowing the AI to select the best move based on the results of the simulation. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Monte Carlo algorithm in the game ""Battleship"" and its strengths and weaknesses."
Koncz Krisztian ,Musical hide and seek," Summary:

The theme of my bachelor's thesis is the development of a web application. This application helps users get to know old and new acquaintances through their musical taste. The musical taste of a person reveals a lot about their personality. If we know someone's musical taste, it's easier to start a conversation which is useful in the early stages of a friendship. Such an application, along with get-to-know-you games, is a good icebreaker because it can be funny to get to know someone through music. Furthermore, we can discover new musical genres or songs. The online interface enables us to use the application even when we are not in the same location. We can get closer to our colleagues during online classes or work."

Portik Andrea ,CONNECTIVE: Application to connect mentor and mentee," The topic of my thesis is a mobile application that connects mentors and mentees. Nowadays, we want to reach everything easily and quickly both in our private life and at work, and smartphones also contribute to this, as they greatly facilitate our everyday tasks. But in a new environment or place, in order to be able to carry out the work smoothly, it is good if someone shows us what we actually have to do. We can perform more effectively if we have concrete goals and their corresponding specifications and priorities.

There are two types of users in the project: mentors and mentees. They are connected in an Android mobile application. The application allows mentors to create tasks for a mentee after logging in. In addition, mentors have the option to add new members to the group. And the mentees are informed about the activities related to them after logging into the application.

Just like the mentors, mentees also have the opportunity to modify and view the tasks. The goal of the project is not for the mentor to be able to monitor the mentee, but only guidance is the main principle. The developed application enables users to display and modify their own personal data. All this in order to establish more connections between the mentor and the mentee, thus facilitating more efficient work."
Szabo Zoltan ,Genetic algorithms in pattern recognition," Nowadays, pattern recognition programs play an increasingly important role. Pattern recognition programs can be used in everyday life, such as in the case of snapchat filters. They can also be used in agriculture, for example, a drone program that examines the health of plants.

Nowadays, neural networks are used in pattern recognition. However, they have several disadvantages. These problems include high storage usage and teaching costs.

In my thesis, I present the use of genetic algorithms in pattern recognition. I begin by explaining the concept of the genetic algorithm and providing an example of how it works. Then, I present the genetic algorithm I use, which I built around attribute chains to create a pattern recognition program.

In my thesis, I compare a polygon in an input image with a certain predefined set of polygons and determine which polygon is included in the input polygon. I perform this search using a genetic algorithm, examining the fitness value over several generations. The member with the best value then becomes the solution.

I obtain members for each generation by crossing and mutating the members of the previous generation and using elitism on the previous generation."

Siko Mark Levente ,MuresTracker - City issue tracker," The topic of my paper is ""MuresTracker: A Software That Enables City Residents to Report Issues and Facilitates Efficient Management of These Problems by City Authorities""

City administrations face numerous challenges on a daily basis that impact the quality of life for residents. Potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, crime, safety concerns, and similar issues are present in the daily lives of residents, and their dissatisfaction is not always expressed in the most appropriate places. Therefore, cities require effective tools for tracking and addressing problems. MuresTracker ""addresses this problem"" by providing a platform for residents to report issues and track their status, while also enabling city officials to confront and resolve these problems.

The website serves as a valuable tool for improving communication, increasing civic engagement, monitoring and managing problems, and promoting more efficient urban services. It offers a wide range of user-friendly reporting and tracking capabilities and can have a positive impact on residents’ lives and the efficiency of cities.

The application allows registered regular users to add and view problems reported by others in the city, including details, location, and who and when they were resolved. Users with administrator roles are responsible for directing problems of a certain category to the appropriate department. Additionally, they have insight into user information and can modify or deactivate users in case of inappropriate behavior."
Balazs Endre ,The interactive adventures of UnitTiby: The role of algorithmic games in education," The topic of my paper is the role of algorithmic games in education. Nowadays, students are growing up alongside digital technologies, using smartphones, playing computer games, and actively participating in the online world. Compared to previous decades, forms of entertainment have undergone significant changes, greatly influencing modern education. Teachers need to employ new methods and techniques to sustain interest and stimulate further learning. Gamification, or the use of game elements, is a very important component of modern education and can provide an effective solution to changing teaching needs. I conducted a research study among students in Transylvania, where I gathered their opinions on the usefulness of various game elements in relation to learning. These game elements are all associated with gamification. Based on my own experiences, educational games can greatly assist the learning process. Their greatest advantage is that they allow learning useful things in a highly enjoyable and playful manner. My goal was to create an educational game that incorporates the game elements found to be advantageous in my research.

The purpose of the game I developed is to help users grasp the basics of the C programming language. The protagonist of the game is a university student named UniTiby, whom the user can control. Before each task, the player receives the necessary information to solve the given level. Each lesson is accompanied by a maze. The user is presented with questions and tasks that require decision-making, but by utilizing the new information, they can navigate through the maze.

The main objective of the educational game is to avoid monotony, which is why it features highly diverse environments. Environmental elements also appear randomly."
Fekete Daniel ,Scientific journal rankings according to categories," In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the need to stay connected and informed has become more crucial than ever. The accessibility and usability of websites play a significant role in facilitating efficient information retrieval and knowledge sharing. Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis is to investigate the creation of a user-friendly and intuitive website. This website aims to provide extensive rankings of academic journals using the SCimago Journal Rank (SJR) database and its associated metrics. We can edit scientific journals, or more precisely, we can add important information that is not included in the database used, such as the academic year in which it was published, or the title of the scientific article. The search results can be saved as PDF files for convenient access later on. Moreover, visitors also have the opportunity to contribute to the website's database by adding new journals, thereby helping to expand the range of available information.

To gain access to the data on the website, visitors are requested to register, enabling them to perform searches and contribute new information. The primary objective of this thesis is to present a step-by-step guide to building a website that is easily accessible to users worldwide, ensuring a seamless browsing experience. Throughout this research, I will explore a variety of methodologies and techniques implemented during the development phase, offering insights into the underlying technologies that were utilized. Furthermore, this thesis aims to shed light on the evaluation criteria employed to establish the journal ranking system within the website. By analyzing and processing relevant data, the ranking methodology will be delineated, providing users with a reliable and informed basis for their academic pursuits.

Next, I will proceed to outline the assessment standards employed in the construction of the website's knowledge base, specifically pertaining to the ranking of scientific journals. Subsequently, I will examine the website's design and functionality from both the user's and developer's perspectives. Lastly, I will thoroughly investigate the measures implemented to ensure the website's accessibility for all users, regardless of their abilities."
Fodor Lehel ,Visualization of geometric equilibrium points," In a two-person game, the purpose of both players is obviously to win by following the rules and regulations. Therefore, each player resorts to the strategy that results in their greatest benefit. However, there are games where if one player applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, the set of strategy in which neither player can increase their profit by changing their strategy, if their opponent doesn't change their strategy, is called the Nash equilibrium point.

In my thesis, the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, both mathematically and from a programming perspective, using the prisoner's dilemma problem. Additionally, I will cover the following topics: the introduction of basic game theory concepts, the prisoner's dilemma, the presentation of an applied algorithm, and the interpretation of the result.

To compute this equilibrium point, I apply the Lemke-Howson algorithm. For visualization of the obtained equilibrium point, I use Python as my programming language. The goals also include introducing the reader to the world of game theory and helping users with average mathematical and information technology skills understand the Nash equilibrium."
Pallfy Roland ,Decentralized messaging and data sharing," Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications.

The traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives.

Decentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed protocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decentralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information.

Similarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can securely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, decentralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.

While decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data authenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability.

The aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it."
Kovacs Bence ,F1 Ticket Manager - Online ticket management," Currently, the rapid spread of online ticket purchasing can be observed due to technological advancements and the increased accessibility of the internet. Through an online platform, people can now conveniently and quickly purchase tickets for various events such as concerts, theater performances, or sports events like Formula 1.

Online platforms provide detailed information about events, including dates, venues, and descriptions. Additionally, online ticket purchasing allows for ticket comparisons, price and type selections, which help customers find the best options available.

Technological developments, such as secure online payment systems and electronic tickets, have contributed to the widespread adoption of online ticket purchasing. Customers can easily and safely make payments through online platforms (webshops) and receive electronic tickets that can be presented on their mobile devices or in printable form at the event.

Online ticket purchasing simplifies event attendance, as customers no longer have to wait in long queues at ticket counters. The purpose of the F1 Ticket Manager application is to provide a ticket purchasing platform for Formula 1 races. Additionally, I have implemented secure purchasing and admission processes through two-step ticket authentication."
Kovacs Lehel Levente ,AlgoRythmics Universe: 3D Game Mechanics," With the rapid advancement of technology, numerous new possibilities have opened up before us, fundamentally transforming our everyday lives. These changes have not only affected communication and work but have also had an impact on entertainment and learning.

Video games offer interactive entertainment, immersing their users in a world created by another person. We can interact with events that we couldn’t even imagine a hundred years ago because they seemed unrealistic to us. However, modern game development technologies allow us to experience these in a virtual environment. We are capable of simulating battles, constructing cities, piloting spaceships anywhere in the galaxy, or even observing the explosion of a planet.

Movies or even entire books can be adapted so that we can live through their stories interactively. The only limit is human imagination.

Video games have not only created an entirely new and infinite world of entertainment but also enable us to gamify education within the framework of schools and universities. In every field, from finance to programming, we can find at least one game aimed at the user’s development.

The main topic of my essay discusses the foundations of software that provide interactive entertainment on electronic devices. We have a multitude of software available to build and sell games with minimal time and financial investment. However, it is important to understand the fundamental elements of game development, the rules of the game, in other words, the game mechanics. These require technical considerations in order for our software to successfully achieve its intended goal."
Pall Arnold Barna ,EventsApp," In today’s fast-paced world, more and more things are happening around us. It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with all the events on a day-to-day basis. Many apps have event tracking features, one of the biggest and most well-known being Facebook. However, the emphasis on Facebook is more on interaction between people, so the functionality of the event tracker may not be the best. In our country, the use of applications designed for similar purposes may not be as widespread as in foreign countries, but it can be a challenge to find an application that can satisfy all the expectations of the user.

The purpose of event tracking applications is to allow users to track preferred events based on time, location, and other important information such as description. In my thesis, I will create an application of this type, which we can access with the help of our phone. Almost everyone has a smartphone that is always with us wherever we go. Such an application can only help in the everyday fast-paced world.

The objective of my project is to create an iOS application that can help us follow our preferred events, get information about the given events, and can also help us plan our participation. The application uses Swift programming language, SwiftUI framework for creating user interfaces, and Firebase development platform for database management."
Komuves David Mark ,Web platform for generating and managing tax invoices," Today, the number of private entrepreneurs and businesses is growing. The idea of running a business has become more normalized. It no longer seems that only someone of the calibre of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates can run a company. So, more and more young people are trying, and more new businesses are being born. However, the optimal functioning of a modern business requires the right tools to help monitor certain behaviors, create a successful client-provider communication interface, help manage the resources of the business, or even shorten the time taken up by paperwork.

The aim of my thesis is to find a simple, fast and attractive solution for the latter of these, more specifically for the generation and storage of tax invoices. The application I have created aims to be a guaranteed solution for businesses and entrepreneurs who sell services or products and need to generate invoice statements.

The application can be made highly accessible thanks to its web-based format. I have created an easy-to-use schema for editing and saving invoices. The application also leaves room for users who do not wish to log in, but for users with an account, it provides an archive that helps not only to visualize the already created invoices but also to highlight them statistically.

The interface data is stored in a MongoDB database, which is managed by a Node.js based REST API using Express.js and Mongoose libraries - I would call this the backend of the project. The frontend part of the project was implemented using Vue.js 3 JavaScript framework."
Matyus Borka Erzsebet ,Visualizing furnishings in 3D room within a mobile application," Online shopping is thriving in today’s world. Customers strive to choose convenient solutions for furnishing their homes, and the first step is purchasing furniture. In recent years, online shopping has gained a significant advantage over in-person shopping with physical contact. To achieve this, there are numerous options available to interested individuals, ranging from online stores published on websites to ordering via phone calls and specifically developed mobile applications.

Taking these aspects into account, I have chosen a theme for my project that aligns with current trends while also incorporating innovative technologies to enhance the user experience. My project implements an online furniture store within an Android application. The app provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for both the seller, who fulfills the role of an administrator, and the buyer, who acts as a user.

From a design perspective, the user interface is clean, easily understandable, and manageable for everyone, while also offering all the necessary functions for a seamless shopping experience. Users can create their own accounts, allowing them to browse the application at their leisure, favorite products for future reference, and complete the purchase process.

Perhaps the only drawback of online shopping is the difficulty in physically observing the products due to the absence of physical presence. While physical shopping allows us to use all our senses to select and examine items from every angle, touch them, and rotate them, online shops generally do not offer solutions to these issues.

In my project, I have endeavored to overcome this drawback by implementing a virtual room feature that allows buyers to not only view images and read descriptions of desired products but also observe them in 3D, rotate them, and place them proportionally within a room. This functionality enhances the shopping experience and reduces the risk of returns by offering customers the opportunity for more thorough observation."
Nyitrai Orsolya Eva ,Automated baccalaureate exam result gatherer and visualizer system," My thesis topic is implementing an automated system that aims to collect, clean, and visualize the baccalaureate exam results for Romanian students for the end users. The baccalaureate exam results are of paramount importance not only for students and teachers but also for educational institutions alike. These data greatly influence the future possibilities of students, whether it's about career opportunities or further education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools.

Visualizing these results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of teaching programs. In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience, which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set.

I felt the need to develop such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays. I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency and normalization for future use.

The user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations. The server-side application was built with the Nest.js framework, utilizing the TypeScript language, and it is responsible for managing and serving the data.

The foundation of the architecture consists of the scraper and cleaning systems. The web scraper was developed in GoLang, which is suitable for the efficient handling and processing of large data sets. For data cleaning and pre-processing, I used the Python language, specifically the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool.

Additionally, I worked with various other libraries and technologies, which will be discussed in more detail later on. The main goal in selecting the aforementioned technologies was not only to enable easy and fast access to the data, more accurate inference drawing, and better understanding of the result for everyone but also to ensure that the system is future-proof and allows further development."

Tanko Tamas ,Examining social phenomena in a real company’s email communication network," The topic of my paper is the examination of social phenomena in a real company's email communication network. In this research, I compare the execution times of algorithms applied to different graphs. I connect social phenomena with computer algorithms and graph theory. In a favorable scenario, I did not work with fictional elements but used the real email communication database of the Enron company. During my interdisciplinary research, I conducted data mining to exclusively examine internal relationships within the company, thereby reducing the number of nodes used in the graph. Through these operations, I utilized various graph-theoretical algorithms such as depth-first search and the Girvan-Newman method. The real database provides the opportunity to examine the dynamics of the network, allowing us to track the formation of connections, which can be visualized as well."
Kocsis Lorand ,Flexible work program follower," The topic of my thesis is monitoring flexible work schedules, which provides a solution to the challenges encountered when a workplace adopts a flexible work program and tracking employees’ entries and exits becomes a complex task, especially when remote work is allowed, which is becoming increasingly common, particularly for office jobs. There are two main reasons why solving this problem is necessary: the company can track the number of hours worked by employees per day and comply with the monthly requirement of submitting attendance sheets to the state. The aim of my project is to offer a relatively simple solution for monitoring employees’ working hours and recording their breaks, as well as meeting legal requirements. Employees can register their entry and exit from the system with a single button press. Additionally, the system provides the capability to generate attendance sheet documents for predetermined periods or time intervals, for accounting purposes. Such corporate issues are addressed by Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. So, I have developed a module in the paper that communicates with a database and a website that interacts with this system."

This means that even small service providers, who could not previously afford to develop an application like this, can now use it. SmartCalendar thus presents opportunities for more efficient time management and the growth of small businesses.

My paper provides a detailed explanation of how the application works and its customer notification capabilities. It also discusses how the app makes this functionality available to users at no cost. SmartCalendar opens up new possibilities for personal and business productivity."
Burszan Hunor ,Exploring Distribution Forecasting with Amazon Forecast," Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many industries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively manage inventory, optimize their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and marketing strategies, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently. It allows companies to minimize stock shortages and overstocks, optimize stock levels, and reduce storage and warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimize design and production processes. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production schedules, and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies to better understand their customers’ needs and behavior. This allows the development of personalized product offerings, the optimization of sales and marketing strategies, and the delivery of a better customer experience. Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Insufficient inventory causes customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, while oversupply is costly in terms of storage and logistics. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect of good demand forecasting.

Over the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand forecasting. The continuous development of forecasting methods and techniques, as well as the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of forecasting. In addition, improvements in data management and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts.

The aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some products by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon Forecast web service. This service does not require prior knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper presents the complete process required to produce the forecasts, including the associated logic, and the desktop application designed to manage the Forecast by communicating with the service. The results of the forecasts are displayed and interpreted."
Gabos Alpar ,EduLane: Course Guide in Your Pocket," The topic of my thesis is to simplify learning through online courses using software. With the help of modern technologies used today, almost anything can be learned through online courses. This form of online learning is becoming increasingly popular, resulting in a growing number of such courses available on the market.

Lukacs Krisztina Beata ,Developing computer thinking: programming techniques. Tasks and their automatic correction assurance software.," With this thesis, I would like to help programmers, especially students, who have difficulties with programming techniques. ""Practice with Five Techniques"" is a local platform, which contains exercises mainly in Hungarian language and with different programming techniques. The user needs to register and log in to both view and select exercises. It provides automatic correction of exercises that the user solves, runs with the given inputs and then sends for correction. A final rating, a score, is the feedback to the user on the exercises he has solved, and it is summarized in a table. The interface is designed to help people who want to practice and improve their logic and computational thinking. It is more suitable for high school or university students who already have some knowledge of programming techniques."
Major Zsolt ,Create and import basketball league and statistical survey data into .Net Maui," In the realm of competitive sports, it is not uncommon for individuals who follow a contest from the sidelines to immerse themselves in the world of competition to such a degree that they passionately cheer for a favorite side or even place bets on certain competitors. The competitive curiosity of humans can manifest in various ways, ranging from the frenzy of cheering alongside numerous other fans at a live match to everyday conversations with friends at a bar on who will win today’s big game.

Building upon this idea, I have developed a computer application that offers two important possibilities for users to solve dilemmas that arise in the realm of basketball championships: a system for importing and recording team and player performances, which enables us to create complex and advanced insights not only into an athlete’s personal statistics but also to compare them with those of another party; and a championship creation program where we can form teams led by others, engage in matches with them, and maintain rankings based on those matches.

To implement this system, I have developed a .Net MAUI program based on the C# language. It utilizes a MySQL-based phpMyAdmin database system to store and retrieve data for teams, players, and their statistics. Additionally, through an API, there is a possibility to fetch statistics of real NBA players and teams for different seasons, which will be used to create multi-layered metric measurements.

My application can be divided into three distinctive menu sections. The first one is the league creator, where users can employ personally created clubs in various matches. Within this section, they can assign statistics and final results to players associated with the teams and also rank the teams and players based on different criteria.

The second section is the team and player creator, where users can create teams, customize them, and also retrieve and store the seasonal performances of real teams and players in the database.

The third section, which is also a crucial one, is the comparison and evaluation section, where imported teams and players can be evaluated and compared using different complex metrics and graphs based on the imported information based on their performance.

Keywords: basketball, personalized championship, match maintenance, comparisons, statistics, metrics, competitive curiosity, data mining."

The purpose of my state exam thesis is to provide a quick and easy-to-use attendance registration system that guarantees accurate and safe registration of students’ attendance and prevents the possibility of fraud.

The introduction of the system at a university or a school can promote more efficient and safer education, contributing to the satisfaction and effectiveness of students and teachers."
Jakab Etele ,Stock price prediction and visualization," One of the most studied sectors in economics and financial analysis is stock trading, where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets. It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries, which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks. The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and minimize risks.

The fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.

The thesis consists of two main chapters. In the first chapter, I focus on a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles, and already implemented functionalities. In the second chapter, I introduce two independently developed and separate prediction systems and a third approach resulting from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.

The aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them, process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using visualization tools. From a program design perspective, I followed the modern principle of allowing for easy expansion and post-development modifications of the application.

The research section aimed to develop a method capable of providing highly accurate predictions regarding market changes based on past market data and news feeds. These methods were tested, results were documented, compared with each other, and essential conclusions were drawn.

The social goal of the research is to facilitate safer stock market investments and protect people’s savings, particularly during a period when economic prospects are rather turbulent. In 2022, the average annual inflation in the European Union was 10.4%, in Hungary 24.5%, and in Romania 14.1%. In contrast, the average annual deposit interest rates in Hungary were 6.1%, and in Romania, they reached 7.2%."

Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this. The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can have a community-building impact. The name of my application is ""SimultanQ."" ""Simultan"" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix ""Q"" stands for ""Quiz."" Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register, create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the questions based on this information. The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implementation of engaging games in various topics for different groups, testing knowledge, and the competitive approach can provide a genuine team-building experience."

My goal was to make the application easy to use and accessible from anywhere, and to provide a user experience that balances comfort and functionality.

Throughout the years, it has become evident that the services offered by the online world play an increasingly important role in our everyday lives. Nowadays, many of our activities, whether it is shopping, entertainment, or even work, are done over the Internet, from the comfort of our homes. One of the most important branches of online services is public administration. If we allow citizens to handle these matters through the Internet, we can significantly ease their burden. With an online state system, there is no need for citizens to be present at a specific time or to stand in long queues just to fill out, sign, and submit a few papers.

In this thesis, I developed software for one of the use cases mentioned above, namely sales contracts. I tried to find answers to the following questions: what technologies should be used to make it easy to develop such an application, and what design frameworks and practices can be used to maximize the user experience? I also tried to find out how modern web standards, such as WebSockets, can be useful in such an application.

I present the technologies used during development, the design and implementation process of the end-user part of the software, and the various use cases that the software must support. Finally, I summarize the experiences gained during development and testing and present the possibilities for further development."

Vrencian Lilla ,Dockerization and development of eTickets application in .NET," The topic of my thesis is the development and dockerization of the ""eTickets"" web application in .NET programming language. This application allows users to buy tickets online for movies in different cinemas. Online shopping has been growing in popularity in recent years and has become a common practice in many companies. There are several reasons why it was introduced:

1. Convenience: Online shopping allows customers to access the Internet from home, work or anywhere and easily purchase the products or services they want. They do not need to be in person at traditional stores or make an appointment.
2. Wide selection: In the online space, customers have access to a huge selection of products and services from many parts of the world. They are not limited to the inventory of local stores and can easily compare prices, brands and quality from the comfort of their own home.
3. Time saving: Online shopping is fast and efficient. Customers don’t have to go through multiple stores or stand in line to pay. They can simply buy and pay for a product or service with a few clicks.

Because of these advantages, many companies decide to introduce or expand online shopping to reach and serve a wide range of online shoppers."
Stoica Attila ,Visualizer for dynamic programming algorithms," The topic of my paper is ""Visualizing the Algorithm of Dynamic Programming through an Easily Applicable Interface."" Dynamic programming is an efficient and creative method for problem-solving. Its foundation lies in storing and reusing optimal solutions. It's a bit like a memory game, where by leveraging previous steps, you can more easily find the solution. This saves time and resources. Dynamic programming is used in optimization, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.

The clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students. Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems and by solving these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples and practical applications, allowing them to see how dynamic programming can assist them in various areas of life, such as data analysis or video game development.

By incorporating unique interactive exercises and creative approaches, you pique students' interest and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fosters the development of their creativity, logical thinking, and ability to work in teams. The goal of my paper is to present dynamic programming as comprehensively and uniquely as possible, thereby capturing students’ attention and laying the foundation for their future IT skills.

I aimed to achieve this through a website, primarily because it is easily accessible and applicable to anyone. Furthermore, it was crucial for the visualization to be carried out through tasks that perfectly reflect the fundamental properties of the algorithm, such as dividing problems into subproblems and memoization. Additionally, I strived to create a user-friendly interface where the visualization speed can also be adjusted."
Kiss Krisztina Gyongyver ,Title of the Bachelor thesis TastyGo: Application for a restaurant with delivery," The restaurant industry and online ordering options have seen rapid growth in recent years, creating a growing demand for convenient and easy food delivery (The restaurant industry and online ordering options have seen significant growth in the past few years, making it easier and more desirable for people to order food for delivery). People want to bring the restaurant experience to their homes without sacrificing comfort and relaxation. In this digital age, restaurants need to keep up with consumer demands and find ways to serve customers in the online space (Restaurants must adapt to the digital age by finding new ways to serve customers in the online realm as more and more people opt for convenience and ease). This is where a restaurant delivery app comes into play, allowing for easy and fast food ordering and delivery (An app designed specifically for restaurant food delivery is an essential tool that enables customers to place orders quickly and easily).

The goal is to create an application that enables the restaurant to provide customers with a convenient and simple way to order from their menu (The primary objective of this app is to make it as easy as possible for customers to browse menus, place orders, and complete transactions through the app). Through the app, customers can browse a wide range of dishes, view detailed descriptions and prices, and easily create their order (Using the app, customers can explore various menu items in depth, examine prices and descriptions carefully, and quickly submit their orders).

The app also allows for online payment, ensuring a seamless process for both users and the restaurant (An additional convenience of the app is that it offers customers the ability to pay for their meals online, streamlining the ordering process for all involved parties). The benefits of a delivery app extend beyond customer convenience and also result in more efficient and successful restaurant operations (Besides making the ordering experience easier for customers, apps can significantly improve restaurant efficiency and profitability).

With the app, the restaurant can easily manage orders, track the delivery process, and optimize resources (The use of a delivery app allows restaurants to streamline order processing, monitor delivery statuses in real-time, and allocate resources more efficiently). Additionally, the app enables customer data management and the building of customer relationships, which can lead to loyal customers and positive feedback in the long run (By capturing and analyzing customer information through the app, restaurants can cultivate stronger connections with their clientele, fostering long-term loyalty and encouraging positive reviews).

Torok Csongor ,Algorythmics on the Chessboard," Throughout history, only a few things, apart from minor improvements, have remained almost unchanged from the early Middle Ages to our present times and represent the same board game for millions of people. It has no hidden parts or any elements of chance; everything is in front of the two players from the beginning to the checkmate. Despite this, one of the biggest changes brought to chess came from the programs and algorithms created by computer scientists over the past decades. These offered a deeper insight into the world of chess, calculating the best moves from any given position, from an unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole new dimension of depth since we could analyze every single detail, and the most optimal strategy could be generated in mere seconds.

With my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to solve chess problems and puzzles that even thousands of years ago could have occupied people. My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess' complexity, is to clarify these algorithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.

My chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways. In a given example, they choose the best moves by analyzing the current situation or find a solution by testing all possible cases. By saving running times, I tried to present the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing ways with the help of the most effective methods.

Last but not least, popularizing chess and arousing interest in it for others was another goal of mine since anyone can be an expert of the game of kings, and similar programs can help a lot in mastering it."
Bakó László Mihály ,Open doors with human-machine interface: a new approach to password-free secure access," In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication. In the proposed approach, the active interface, which monitors some biometric process, serves as a non-transferable authentication token based on a secure “dead man switch.” If the connection is terminated, the system automatically revokes the privileges and logs the user out. To avoid forgery and impersonation, the system uses a one-time key protected communication protocol between the clients and the server managing access to resources. In this research, we analyzed possible solutions based on the criteria of security, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. We implemented a system based on a comfortable wearable visual cortex activity monitor and a low-cost heart rate monitoring system. The completed systems were tested to assess their reliability and safety. The results of the research show that the combination of non-transferable authentication tokens, biometrics, and communication protocol offers a promising alternative to password or simple token-based access control systems, as it improves security and allows for more flexible security roles, such as temporary authorized security roles."
Derzsi Daniel ,Project Raccoon - Management of a Platform to Streamline Contract Creation and Property Sales Through the Web," In today’s fast-paced world, individuals and businesses engaged in real estate transactions often encounter significant challenges when drafting property sale contracts. The creation of these property sale contracts is an integral part of real estate transactions, involving complex legalities and meticulous documentation. There is a pressing need for an intuitive tool that can alleviate these complexities and facilitate the creation of accurate and legally compliant contracts.

The aim of my thesis is two-fold. Firstly, I intend to create the basis of an online platform to allow the automatic creation of contracts for secure property sales. This includes the creation and planning of the necessary software architecture, the development of an easy-to-use administration interface, as well as the verbatim generation and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators.

Secondly, I intend to document the various stages (and possibilities) of the final deployment, measured within real-world conditions. The proposed website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering users a friendly interface to generate legally binding contracts tailored to their specific requirements. By eliminating the need for extensive legal knowledge or the assistance of costly attorneys, the time and effort required to create a contract is greatly reduced.

Comparatively, governments worldwide have implemented similar software solutions to address the challenges associated with property sale contracts. However, these government-backed endeavors are often significantly handicapped by their perceived obscurity and their convoluted design choices. This platform aims to provide users with a unique and simplified experience that surpasses existing government initiatives.

In the beginning of the thesis, we will discuss the various technologies employed to create the proposed software solution. Afterwards, we will describe what the software will do and how it is expected to perform as part of a Software Requirements Specification. A prospective user interface for the platform will be detailed following the proposal of a potential software architecture and deployment layout. Finally, some measurements will be presented to rationalize the decisions taken during the planning stages of the software architecture."
Csegzi Hunor ,System to collect and elaborate data in superior education," In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior education to ensure quality. I started to develop a web application, in which it is possible to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it enter data and organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.

Prior to the development, I considered several alternative solutions, but in conclusion, the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC report, which was initially unknown to me as well; thus, I learned and discovered it both during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process.

The most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be dynamically edited and implemented in XML format. Furthermore, it is easier to implement with the system packages I have chosen. The development of the system was guided by opinions from those who have to elaborate data to create reports.

The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary; therefore, I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests of the target user. The most important thing is that the user community accepts it and is happy to use it.

This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of teachers involved in education but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during its years. With simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that meets current design conditions. Thus, the system and website I have designed and implemented provide a user-friendly environment for both clients and the designer."
Molnar Krisztian ,Visualizations of large collections of images," Currently, we have access to large image collections, both personally and in research. Visualizing these collections can contribute to the discovery of latent patterns. The topic of my thesis is the display and visualization of large image collections in various layouts. The size of the image collections I used exceeds forty thousand images, but the theoretical upper limit surpasses this by far. I have developed an application that can display the images from the opened collection and arrange them based on extracted metadata, all within seconds.

My application is built on a client-server architecture. The server is written in Rust (using the Axum framework). The client, running in the browser, is built in TypeScript and consists of two main parts. The desired layout can be selected through a user interface created with React, and this code is also responsible for the settings of the selected layout. The part responsible for image display does not use a framework but follows a custom-designed architecture. The WebGL library is used for rendering the images.

The application has gone through several development cycles. In the following sections, I will present the design decisions necessary for displaying image collections of this size and support them with measurements. Furthermore, I will showcase the layouts generated by the application for the collection I used."
Kolumban Attila ,Rubik’s cube solver for phones," The Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most iconic and most interesting puzzle games. The first Rubik's Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a Hungarian architect, sculptor, and game designer. Since its inception, it has become popular worldwide, entertaining millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik's Cube demands attention, patience, and strategic thinking from its user. But thanks to improvements in modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.

Thanks to improvements in our smart devices and automated robots, solving the Rubik's Cube has reached new levels. These days, Rubik's Cube solver applications are available on personal computers and smartphones, making the learning of new solving algorithms a lot easier.

Usually, an application like this shows a 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution and show it to the user. The user can copy these steps onto his or her own cube, this way helping him or her develop his or her own skills.

Usually, it's a plus if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the cube more. My software is able to read in a real cube using the camera of a smart device, this way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, which he or she can go through step by step, or if he or she feels like it, he or she can try to solve the cube himself or herself.

Aside from this, I wanted to implement a feature where the user can learn given solving algorithms. For this reason, there is a separate menu where the user can choose a solving algorithm and can see its steps on the cube. The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution, I used Kociemba's two-step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well-liked for its speed and low solution step count."
