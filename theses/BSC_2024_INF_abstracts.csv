Bartis Andrea ,Little Heaven - Confectionery Website," Little Heaven Confectionery was founded in 2020. Since then, we have been spoiling our sweet tooth customers in the city. From cakes to cheesecakes, every product is prepared with charm, passion, and elegance. However, we often face the stark reality that customers can't see all the products we create on our Instagram and Facebook pages.

The confectionery website called Little Heaven is the perfect solution to this problem. The goal of the site is to help customers be able to browse between all the different products we have created over the last 4 years. Users can easily access each product, which is accompanied by images, details, and the price.

Products are displayed in categories. This makes it easy for the user to search for any product, such as macarons. On top of that, they can also communicate and receive guidance from us. Users can get in touch with us both by phone and email. We also have a map included on the site so they can find our physical location much faster.

The site has a simple and easy-to-use interface. Our customers save time and can find the desired product much easier. On top of that, they don't have to call us to place an order."
Teutsch Mihaly Richard ,RouteTrack: tracking physical activity and transportation patterns," In today’s world, a healthy lifestyle and sustainable transport are receiving more and more attention. People strive to choose environmentally friendly and healthy modes of transportation such as cycling or walking. In addition, fuel consumption and the environmental impact of vehicles play an important role in their decisions. Mobile apps that help you plan routes, track distances and time, and analyze fuel consumption can be a big help in this situation.

These tools can help people choose healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation. The application I developed is a simple and effective tool for tracking and analyzing our traffic habits. The application allows us to record and analyze how much we drive, cycle or walk, and monitor fuel consumption and other important data. This helps us to make more conscious decisions in the field of transport and encourages us to choose healthier and more sustainable alternatives.

The aim of my thesis is to present in detail the application I developed, all its useful functions and advantages. First, I will review research and studies related to healthy lifestyles and transportation to provide a foundation for the topic. I will then present how the planning took place, and give a detailed description of the concrete implementation.

At the end of the thesis, I will summarize the achieved results and make suggestions for further development opportunities."
Balint Csongor Tivadar ,Examining authentication and authorisation in the context of the Exodus project," The Exodus Program Planner aims to create an easy-to-use web application to help the Exodus Discipleship Youth Ministry leadership in their planning. The application speeds up and visualizes the planning process, reducing the possibility of errors and improving the efficiency of the organization by simplifying administration. In this thesis, we will review the different steps of authentication and authorization to gain a more detailed picture of these security processes. By authentication and authorization, most of us think of login and registration as the first step in project implementation. In this context, it is very important to keep in mind the trust of the users and the efficiency and speed of the system, which will allow us to provide a better user experience. In this thesis, I will delve into authentication and authorization, highlight the complexity of the topic, and seek answers to questions such as whether it is necessary to use a JWT token, how passwords should be handled in terms of privacy and efficiency, and what constitutes a proper protocol. To achieve this, I will implement my own authentication and authorization implementation within the framework of a real project, which I will compare with already known processes such as SAML. The conclusions drawn in this thesis will provide answers to the above-mentioned questions, which will also underline the importance of the topic and its relevance in our everyday life."
Albert Toth Szilard ,Applying Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain Tumor Analysis in MRI Scans," Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are among the best-performing networks in the field of computer vision. Their development can assist, for example, radiologists in identifying tumors or determining tumor types in brain MRI images. In my thesis, I compare three convolutional neural networks of varying complexity: VGG16, SimpleCNN, and ComplexCNN. I investigate which one performs the best on two datasets that were developed by others.

My measurements show that on the Kaggle dataset, VGG16 and ComplexCNN perform very similarly, achieving F1-scores of 0.99 and 1.0, respectively. SimpleCNN has an F1-score of 0.90. On the Figshare dataset, SimpleCNN achieves an F1-score of 0.92, while ComplexCNN achieves a score of 0.97.

My measurements contradict the developers of ComplexCNN, who claim in their study that ComplexCNN performs better on image classification tasks than VGG16 and all other networks. In addition to the research, a proof of concept (POC) software was also developed. This software allows users to test the selected network with a brain MRI image in a browser and visually illustrates the classification result."
Albert Henrietta ,Application of Database Technologies on Node.js: A Case Study of a Recipe Management Website," The project ""Application of Database Technologies on Node.js: A Case Study of a Recipe Management Website"" aimed to develop a web-based application that allows users to search for cake recipes and administrators to add, modify, and delete recipes. I will discuss various types of databases in detail, including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Oracle. The differences between databases and their applicability will also be discussed in detail.

The user documentation will provide a detailed description of the main functions of the website, including the home page, user pages, and administrator pages. This will facilitate the use and maintenance of the system.

In summary, the project provides a comprehensive overview of the application of modern web development technologies and methodologies, with a particular focus on the development of web applications for recipe management. The documentation discusses in detail the technical solutions and their practical application, thus helping developers to implement similar projects."
Demeter Evelin Delinke,LearnIT: The power of grading systems and feedbacks," Different technologies and the use of mobile phones are increasingly common nowadays. These modern tools have become an integral part of our everyday lives, making tasks such as communication, work, and study much easier. It's challenging for us to be apart from them, and it's almost impossible to get along without them. The new generation would struggle if they had to do without these tools since it's natural for them that all information is available at the click of a button. While this level of technology integration has its advantages, it also brings many disadvantages that we don't pay enough attention to.

In the past decade, education has undergone significant changes due to technological innovations. Traditional teaching methods have been replaced by modern, digital approaches, and students have adapted to a different learning environment. The introduction of digital teaching materials, online educational platforms, virtual classrooms, and electronic diaries has made the learning process more flexible and interactive. Additionally, it's important to digitize surveys to provide students with immediate feedback on their performance.

My colleague and I designed and implemented an application called LearnIT. This app facilitates independent learning through interactive quiz questions, which is a well-proven teaching method. It offers features such as immediate grading, an overview of answers, and a teacher platform that allows for the introduction of various fields of expertise in addition to programming languages. It's extremely important these days to receive feedback as soon as possible, regardless of any area. Positive feedback can motivate us, and negative feedback can lead us to what we need to improve.

In my thesis, I aimed to examine the effectiveness of the grading system used in the mobile application developed. I want to emphasize that LearnIT was tested in a real environment at Sapientia College of Informatics and Technical Sciences by students of this faculty."
Abram Szilveszter ,Cronotus - Web application for organizing sporting events," Physical activity and practicing various sports are an integral part of people’s everyday lives. In order to live a healthy life, we all choose different sports, in which we invest energy and time every day. Physical exercise has proven to have not only physical benefits but also significant effects on mental health. Furthermore, the people we do sports with can determine the quality of the time we spend exercising.

Choosing the right community for doing sports and everyday activities is a challenge that everyone faces, as it has a great impact on our lives. The purpose of this thesis is providing a platform that serves as a middleman for people who want to connect with others and combat the problem of not having company to exercise. Cronotus provides an online platform where people can easily overcome the problem of not having company to exercise. The application allows one to organize, search for sports events, ensuring that no one is left at home because they had no one to go out with. The project also aims to make certain events easy to follow, providing organizers with the opportunity to provide up-to-date information to athletes. This can help the community find the events that are most suitable for them."
Laczko Adorjan Richard ,AI learning to race,
Oniga Kriszta ,LearnIT: Quiz-Centered Interactive Teaching Toolkit," With the rise of digitalization, the use of mobile devices have become a key enabler for today's young people, and there is a growing demand for interactive learning tools. The aim of my thesis is to present a quiz-based learning application that we have developed, which tries to put the time spent on the phone to good use. The main goal of the LearnIT application is to learn concepts related to different programming languages through interactive elements. Particular attention is paid to interactive quizzes that allow users to actively participate in the learning process. The application also has a teaching interface that allows the creation of new courses and questions. This allows teachers to personalize the course material and adapt it to the needs of the students, making learning even more effective.

After the implementation of the application, I was able to carry out an experiment consisting of two parts: a test of the application I developed and a follow-up survey. The testing of the application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures, Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania. Using the application, the participants filled in different quizzes for several weeks in parallel with the educational material, and their answers were recorded using a scoring system defined by me. After testing, I processed a total of 25 students’ responses, almost 750 answers.

The answers and scores thus collected were examined. In contrast, the poll was designed to collect the subjective opinions of the participants. In this case, a total of 51 responses were processed. The results show that users had a positive experience, as reflected in the data and scores collected during the use of the application, as well as in the opinions expressed in the questionnaire."
Koncz Hunor ,BudgetHub - Real estate search platform," The real estate market is a rapidly changing and increasingly diverse sector that affects most people directly or indirectly. The buying process can be challenging and time-consuming, especially with the wide range of real estate advertising sites, platforms, offices, and individuals. The varying prices, the quality of the properties advertised for sale, and the differences between them often divide the attention and resources of interested customers.

The aim of my thesis is to create a real estate search web application that provides users with the newest and most up-to-date properties on the market. This is achieved by using a method that collects and processes the necessary information from several existing online advertising platforms. For this, I use a specially developed data collection application.

Additionally, it offers an innovative and intelligent approach to the property buying process. With the help of the application, users can browse properties easily and efficiently."
Golya Gergo ,BudgetHub - Intelligent Real Estate Search," Due to the complexity and diversity of the real estate market, the process of purchasing property poses increasingly greater challenges. With the vast array of options provided by numerous real estate listing websites, agencies, and individuals, finding the most suitable opportunities becomes a time-consuming and energy-intensive task. The aim of my thesis is to develop an artificial intelligence-based real estate search web application that displays the latest and most up-to-date properties to users. The system collects and processes data from multiple online advertising platforms, offering an innovative and intelligent approach to the property purchasing process. Through the application, users can easily and efficiently browse through properties. And through AI-based solutions, they can instantly identify and highlight the most relevant opportunities from the wide range of options available."
Nago Mark ,StandApp - Connecting people through innovative technology for meaningful causes.," We live in a society where we tend to forget about our environment. We only care about events whose outcomes benefit us, and us alone. Why? I cannot give a concrete answer to that. Perhaps that is just the way people are.

There have always been, and still are, a handful of people who put the needs of others before their own. They are a beacon of hope in the world.

The world of information, yet people are staggeringly uninformed about most things, especially about what surrounds them. Would people be able to put their own interests aside if they had more information about their immediate environment, about the events and people in it? To devote their time, energy, and money to a cause that may not boost dopamine levels so intensely at the moment but which in the end gives them much greater pleasure?

Would people be able to connect with each other in a world where everyone, having done what they had to do, just wants to disconnect from society and be left alone? What if this could be changed, and working together as a team could result in a change in their environment, a change in their outlook on life, and even a change in their lives?

Would people be able to give back, and not just take and consume what this world has to offer, if we made the possibilities of helping easily available, at the click of a button from them?

My work aims to inform, connect, and give back through an application which can draw a step closer to a world where people want to change their environment for the better. One thing that I think almost everyone has nowadays is a mobile phone. So, I decided to build this project as a mobile app, supported on both android and iOS platforms, but at the same time with a simple and logical codebase, supported by a strong server side. This combination tries to solve the problem of unfamiliarity.

My objective is to use our generations' new technologies and tools for creating a platform that unites people who want to help through the little changes in their environment. Even other people can join this movement, which I just call ""Stand Up!"""
Nagy Szabolcs ,Something - Self-improvement with the use of gamification and social elements," Gamification leverages the power of game mechanics to motivate people to engage in different activities. It can be applied to almost all aspects of life. For example, it can be used to improve specific skills and behaviors, which can ultimately lead to an improved quality of life. Gamification is not just about integrating technology into existing models, but also about creating entirely new approaches. It reaches communities and inspires individuals toward goals that may not have received sufficient attention before.

In recent years, there has been a surge of gamified solutions. Yet, this huge interest often leads to excessive expectations. The technology sector often finds that exaggerated hype precedes failure. Organizations rush to adopt promising solutions without fully understanding the basic criteria for success.

In developing this application, I have adhered to the definition that effective gamification is about people achieving personal goals. That is, it is not solely focused on organizational goals. However, this aspect should not discourage us from putting gamification at the service of community purposes. Individual and community perspectives often simply reflect different viewpoints on the same fundamental goal.

In my thesis, I investigate how a mobile application, created in the spirit described above, using gamification, can achieve a ""mutually motivating"" effect on individuals. This effect relates to both personal and community goals."
Böjthe Robert Zoltan ,Real-time position correction based on visual input for indoor minidrone navigation," Nowadays, thanks to evolving technology and new demands, hydroelectric power plant operators have started to monitor their plants with monitoring systems instead of permanent on-site staff. Only sending staff to the site when human intervention is really necessary. One popular solution is to use autonomous robots that periodically check the status of the instruments, transmitting the readings to a control center that can react in case of a problem. The goal of my work was to develop a method whereby a GPS-less minidrone can navigate a primarily human-use indoor environment based on visual input alone. With enough accuracy to reliably perform the task of even a hydroelectric monitoring robot. The drone follows a predetermined path, presumably inaccurately as it is not equipped with GPS. To be more precise, it can reposition itself using QR codes placed at critical positions along the route and then continue on its way."
Kovacs Balint Hunor ,Designing and Implementing AniMathIO: A User-Friendly Mathematical Animation Software," This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user-friendly mathematical animation software. The primary objective was to create a tool that simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student satisfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance.

Despite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging. They often require hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere Pro. These tools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform-specific, limiting accessibility.

To address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations.

Initially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users.

AniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries. The software’s architecture was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features.

Key features include a timeline-based editing interface, support for various mathematical objects such as points, lines, vectors, and functions, and export capabilities in multiple formats. The development process was thoroughly documented, and a promotional website was created to showcase the software’s capabilities.

The final product offers a powerful yet simple solution for creating high-quality mathematical visualizations, addressing a gap in the existing software landscape. AniMathIO also aims to be platform-independent, providing a desktop application that can be used on various operating systems. This ensures broader accessibility and usability.

The software combines the ease of traditional video editing software with the capabilities of advanced mathematical animation tools, making it an invaluable resource for mathematics educators and learners alike."
Márk Péter ,DocChat: Integrated Mobile Application for Enhancing Patient-Doctor Relationship and Communication," The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in an efficient, fast, and secure way. People often find themselves in situations where they need help quickly, especially with health issues. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn't know where to go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context.

As we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist. However, for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and appointments on paper. Similarly, well-functioning applications in Romania are only used by larger clinics. Moreover, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts.

Therefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.

The backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real-time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data.

But how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients but also to create a useful interface for doctors. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient.

In addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above. The app not only facilitates contact and communication but can even increase the speed of effective patient care."
Simon Peter ,Username verification system," The topic of my thesis is the automation of username verification using artificial intelligence. Currently, our world is strongly moving towards digitalization, which has brought about a new problem: filtering on platforms. Regarding this filtering process, we will hereby discuss the issue of usernames. It has become increasingly common for people to deliberately choose obscene, offensive, or otherwise objectionable usernames. It is important for site operators to ensure their platforms provide a proper, safe and in some cases, family-friendly environment.

In my thesis, I explain why it is necessary to filter usernames, what potential solutions exist, and present a potentially superior, fine-tuned approach. This involves using machine learning methods and training models on specific datasets to achieve the best possible results. In my research, I draw important conclusions about the training and fine-tuning of models suited for this task in particular.

This research also combines various solutions in an example program. For which, a simple website was created that demonstrates the possible use and further developmental potential of my results. It is important to highlight that the success of the research is also limited by the fact that the best possible results had to be achieved with limited resources.

The thesis offers a brief insight into the world of artificial intelligence applied to the task at hand."
Veress Henrietta ,VolunteerVerse: Client-side implementation of a volunteer coordination platform," Volunteering is an important and noble activity that has a positive impact on both the individual and the community. Nowadays, people have many opportunities to search and browse the web for volunteering activities. however, the plethora of information, the many different websites, and the long and complicated registration processes can easily discourage people from doing so. To start the project, I was motivated by the fact that there is currently no platform, especially in our country, that offers a solution to the above-mentioned problems. My aim was to design and create a web application interface on the client side that would make it easier for individuals, in particular, to search and participate in volunteering activities. The main concern was to enable users to organize or join volunteer groups easily and quickly, without having to contact formal organizations or encounter bureaucratic obstacles. In addition, the app provides organizations with the ability to recruit volunteers for their events and coordinate tasks within those events. I used React to implement the web interface of the system, providing a modern and pleasant user experience. Server and database management is handled by my team member, Szabolcs Siko, but it is part of the overall system. For mobile view, we used .NET MAUI, achieving cross-platform functionality with a single codebase."
Beder Norbert ,Eysenck Personality Test: A Comparative Study of Humans and Large Language Models Through Repeated Administrations," The topic of my thesis is the development of a Eysenck Personality Test web application and the comparison of individuals and Large Language Models based on repeated administrations. Human personality is the phenomenon that makes us unique. Each person has a different personality, and while there may be similar personalities, no two people are exactly alike in the world. This phenomenon determines how we feel, think, and behave in different situations. How we see the world, communicate with others, and respond to challenges all stem from our personality. Many factors influence a person’s personality: genetics, family background, friends, experiences, and life events all shape it. The Eysenck Personality Test application attempts to measure specific dimensions of personality, providing insight into an individual’s characteristic ways of thinking and behaving. Its goal is to help users better understand themselves, track the development or changes in their personalities, and gain a better understanding of how they react to different life situations.

When using the application, the user has one task: to honestly answer the test questions, without overthinking them, as responses should be based on initial impressions. Another important aspect is that the personality test requires multiple completions to examine different measurements. The results I get from the application help me examine the differences and similarities in the two entities’ personality traits.

The aim of the research is to understand the consistency and validity of personality traits based on repeated completions by comparing these two entities. Analyzing the differences in test results provides valuable insights into how these personality tests can be used to better understand personality traits and the functioning of language models. The application is very easy to use, and the test can be completed in a few minutes, with users receiving immediate results. After logging in, users can immediately respond to questions with ""Yes"" or ""No"" answers, and upon completion, they can compare their current result with previous ones if they have already done the test before."
Szentgyorgyi Bernad Krisztian ,FinanceTracker," The topic of my thesis is the development and testing of a financial management mobile application. In today's modern world, cash payments are becoming increasingly rare, and in the case of card payments, we can usually review what we spent our money on. In the application I developed, users can enter and track their expenses and income, view statistics, create predefined budgets, and set goals.

The goal of the application is to provide a user-friendly and simple interface for financial management, thus helping users make more conscious financial decisions. In the thesis, I will detail the design and development processes of the application, present the chosen technologies and solutions, and address the modifications made based on user feedback.

In the thesis, I will thoroughly present the functionalities of the application, especially the income and expense tracking, budget planning, and goal setting. I will describe the steps that determined the final form and operation of the application.

Finally, I will make recommendations for further development of the application and demonstrate how useful such an application can be in the financial management of users."
Siko Szabolcs ,VolunteerVerse - Volunteer Coordination System Server-side Implementation," Volunteering plays a key role in social development and assistance. Nowadays, volunteering has become increasingly important, as the number of people interested in volunteering and willing to act for various community, social or environmental purposes has increased. However, they can be hindered by the difficulty in finding the right opportunities, often due to a lack of information and sometimes by browsing through many different sites to find information about an opportunity.

The thesis was motivated by the realization that there was a need to create a platform that would give people who want to volunteer the opportunity to find volunteering opportunities at their own discretion. The aim was to create a platform where communities could be formed and where anyone could become an organizer and use the platform to promote and coordinate their own volunteering activities.

The thesis presents the functionalities and requirements of a system that allows for a more efficient organization and coordination of volunteering activities. The main focus is on the details of the server-side implementation of the system, covering the design, the architecture, the analysis of the technologies used, and the process of testing its effectiveness.

The aim of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture and operation of the system, as well as its technological background and testing methods."
Magyari Dora ,Personalized content recommandation," I chose the personalized content recommendation system of websites as the topic of my thesis, because user experience and unique content are essential for successful websites. A personalized content recommendation system allows users to access content that is relevant to their interests. This can increase time spent on this site, improve return rates, and build a deeper relationship with the site. The benefits of personalized content recommendation include a unique user experience, increased relevance of content, and increased user satisfaction. The system takes into account users' browsing history and habits, using different algorithms to provide them with more accurate recommendations. This makes it easier for users to find content that matches their interests and discover new things.

My thesis presents a website with images by category. I have chosen to do this because I find the role of images on this type of website extremely important in attracting attention. Images are attractive and quickly grab the attention of users. Therefore, a content recommendation system full of images is an excellent opportunity to capture the interest of users in an entertaining way.

My content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images. Measuring time spent on images can help increase the effectiveness of content recommendation. If users view or explore categories for a longer period of time, this may indicate that the category is interesting or attractive to them. This information allows the system to draw conclusions about users' preferences and tastes.

For example, if someone looks at sports photos for a longer period of time, it may indicate that they are interested in this type of content. Based on this, the system can recommend further similar content, which is more likely to attract their interest."
Majai Henrietta Zita ,Playful e-learning platform to learn the basics of programming," The topic of my thesis is the creation of a playful e-learning platform for learning the basics of programming. Today, e-learning platforms play an increasingly important role in modern education. As technology is rapidly evolving, it is now possible for learners to access the learning materials they need anywhere and anytime, thus facilitating flexible learning and adapting to their individual pace. Learning the basics of programming is essential in such a rapidly evolving world, as IT skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in everyday life and in the labor market. Interactive and playful learning methods can make the learning process more effective, as learners remain more motivated and engaged when they learn in an enjoyable way. The platform offers different mini-games, each of which teaches a key programming concept. In my thesis, I will describe in detail the architecture and operation of the platform, including the technologies used and their benefits. During the development, I used different programming tools and frameworks to make the platform technically stable and user-friendly. I will also describe the technologies and methodologies used and make suggestions for future development."
Máté Noémi ,E-learning platform for different subjects and age groups," Today, teachers are faced with the ever-increasing challenges of everyday teaching. In a world where thousands of images, videos, and information are available to students at the click of a mouse, planning and organizing the teaching process is a constant challenge. Making the pseudo-code on the blackboard, the history lesson in the notebook, or the map of Europe in the atlas even more boring. To overcome this phenomenon, we need a method and a tool which not only arouses but also maintains the interest of the pupils in the subject matter of the lesson. In my research, I developed a web application that uses images, videos, sounds, and interactive exercises to enrich the learning process. Thus, facilitating the teacher’s work in teaching and evaluation. The target group of the research is pupils in grades 5-8. Although the focus is on computer science, I also point out that the tool can be used for teaching any other subject, e.g., history, geography. Using the web application, teacher users can create their own courses with course material and task sets consisting of different types of exercises. A highlight of the application is the use of color and sound cues to help maintain attention and progress through the material when evaluating the solved tasks, with results displayed in visual diagrams."
Schifler Patricia Vivien ,Strategy development and decision-making in games with incomplete information," Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, because they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy. due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behavior of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents.

For these reasons, Liar’s Dice is harder to teach to an AI, since neither the opponent’s move nor the game’s current state can be fully known, only roughly determined. But as the game becomes more complex, this becomes an even more demanding process for both human and machine players. In the game, players play with a given number of dice, and each player guesses by bluffing how many of a given number of dice are in play, and then it is essentially up to luck whether his guess is correct.

This is relatively easy to do with a small number of dice, as there are a finite number of possible moves. But with a larger number of dice, it is more time-consuming to calculate the possibilities. The AI Spy A Lie web game aims to investigate how different agents compete in a game of Liar’s Dice. These agents are based on reinforcement learning. The Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network and State-action-reward-state-action agents choose different moves during the rounds, so that sometimes the agent wins, sometimes the human player wins."
Hegyeli Andras ,BicyHub: The Service Book for Cyclists," The application we will get to know later on is called BicyHub. It aims to provide a platform for all those who love cycling, want to keep a record of their bikes, maintain a logbook to track what happened to their bike, describe their equipment, and keep track of previous owners. There are many places where you can find similar apps for cyclists, so BicyHub is not entirely new. However, what makes it stand out from its peers is that it combines the greater functionality of more familiar applications in one place.

The app in question is a React Native-based cross-platform phone app. The goal was to design and build a comprehensive app that meets almost every need of cyclists, helping them in as many ways as possible. The main feature of the app is the ability to keep a record of cyclist data and its traceability within the platform. This includes the description, value, history, and previous owners of their bikes.

The service log plays an important role, as it provides accurate data about the bike, including minor and major operations and costs. A great advantage, in addition to these features, is the service record. This feature allows users to include specialist services or just individuals who can carry out minor work at home. The current location of these services is shown on a map, along with the owner and evaluation.

Suciu Aksza ,DineEase: Innovative table reservation system for restaurants," The topic of my thesis is the implementation of a unified table reservation system for people and restaurants. As we know, table reservations are most commonly made through phone calls or sending messages. Which can be problematic in cases where the phone number is difficult to find or requires extensive internet searching, often unsuccessfully, making the whole process time-consuming.

The goal of the developed application is to provide an environment where users can quickly find a preferred restaurant and make reservations easily. While restaurants can manage these reservations effortlessly. The emphasis is also placed on user reviews, which help in choosing between restaurants more easily.

Additionally, we could not overlook restaurants dedicated to organizing larger events. I aimed to offer them a way to facilitate communication with interested parties, thus providing a platform for them to schedule personal meetings with event organizers.

Another issue restaurants face is how and where to advertise their upcoming events. Similarly, users may find it challenging to find events they like, as they might not know where to look or might not be informed about them. I wanted to address this by providing an advertising platform within the application.

In my thesis, I discuss how the DineEase application was developed and the methods that can transform it into a well-functioning and user-friendly application that meets user preferences. The implemented application uses a modern approach to solve the problem, and I believe it can revolutionize the lives of both restaurants and users by making the process easier for both parties."
Bagoly Norbert ,Work management application," In today's world, there are increasingly more companies, and new ones are constantly emerging. Every company has its employees, and every company aims for efficient management of human resources and the work performed by employees. With a unified interface where everything can be easily managed, as each company has its own preferences, these can only be maximally satisfied with an application that can be easily personalized.

The aim of my thesis is to create a mobile application that can be integrated with a web-based ERP system. This helps companies track the work done by employees and facilitate communication, both in the form of messages and documents. The foundation of the web system is an Odoo framework-based website, where management has been handled up to now.

However, they couldn't accurately account for the work done, and employees had to log in to the website to send a message or attach a document to a completed task. This led to the idea of greatly simplifying and enhancing the workflow with an application where employees can do all this without needing to connect to the website from their phones.

To implement this, I developed a native Android application using Kotlin. I utilized a local Room database and connected it via XMLRPC to the web interface where data is stored in PostgreSQL. I also had to create a module for the web interface, acting as an API between the Odoo system and my application. This module was written in Python.

Keywords: Work management, ERP system, Android application, Kotlin, XMLRPC, Odoo"

Fodor Laszlo Carlos ,The social platform of the cycling community," The topic of my thesis is a bicycle-centric application that provides users with a social platform to express their passion and interest in cycling. Everyone has their own hobbies, but there are cases where, in certain friend circles, no one shares the same passion for a specific hobby – cycling is one such example. Therefore, the application was created to establish connections among those interested in cycling.

No matter how knowledgeable we are in a particular area, there is always something new to learn, room for development, and the opportunity to expand our knowledge. Users can publicly pose questions, where other users can respond and share their experiences related to the given topic. Additionally, when considering the option to purchase a bicycle, the user has the ability to initiate private messaging.

It is worth mentioning that one of the most important aspects of cycling is the routes we take. Therefore, the app provides the possibility to save and share these routes with other users. It is not uncommon for people to share pictures of things they are proud of on other social platforms. BicyHub users can do the same; they can share their own bike collections in an environment where people can truly appreciate their possessions and the subtle details that only a bike enthusiast would notice."
Béres Tamás ,Data Visualization within the Exodus Project," The topic of my thesis is the creation of an IT system using current technologies to solve problems related to program scheduling. Efficient time management is necessary in all aspects of life today, both at the personal level and at the societal level.

Csegzi Hunor ,System to collect and elaborate data in superior education," In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior education to ensure quality. I started by developing a web application, in which it is possible to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it enter data and organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.

Before the development, I considered several alternative solutions, but in conclusion, the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC report, which was initially unknown to me as well; I learned and discovered it both during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process.

The most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be dynamically edited and implemented in XML format. Additionally, it is easier to implement with the system packages I have chosen. The development of the system was guided by opinions from those who have to elaborate data to create reports.

The elaboration of data has been necessary and will continue to be important, so I kept it a priority throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system based on the information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests of the target user.

This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of teachers involved in education but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during its years of use. With simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that meets current design conditions. Thus, the system and website I have designed and implemented provide a user-friendly environment for both clients and the designer."

Mihaly Etele Levente ,Generating stock market data with function parameter tuning using machine learning," The goal of my thesis is to generate stock market price data using various noise functions and adjacent linkages, accounting for different functions (e.g., sector performance or other related prices). The parameters of these functions can be fine-tuned using machine learning approaches to enhance their similarity to real stock prices. Then, my following goal becomes evaluating the effectiveness of this approach. This approach can yield several beneficial outcomes:

1. Describing stock prices with mathematical relationships can be advantageous for both quick market analysis, where every second counts, and in research.
2. Generating data at a much faster rate and in greater quantities than real-time data flow makes it useful as input data for other machine learning models.
3. Discovering unknown relationships or understanding the impact of different types of noise on the formation or prevention of long-term trends in various research contexts."
Szoverfi Daniel ,ETHna: A secure and user-friendly crypto wallet," My thesis topic is a use case of cryptocurrency wallets and an in-depth analysis of associated security factors. I introduce the application of the cryptocurrency wallet that I developed, called ETHna. Cryptocurrencies are one of the most popular concepts that emerged in the 21st century; the underlying mechanisms of decentralized payments have several advantages. It is important for both investors and lay users to understand the operation of such systems.

In my thesis, I will explain how cryptocurrencies are stored, which is far from the traditional way of storing money. During the critical analysis of various cryptocurrency wallets, I shall pay special attention to why this means of payment and the wallets used for their storage need to be approached from different perspectives. I will present the advantages and disadvantages of hardware, software, and paper wallets, as well as the security risks and protection mechanisms associated with them.

A significant part of the thesis work will be the presentation of the cryptocurrency wallet application I developed. A contemporary and fashionable design prescribes an easy way of storing cryptocurrencies, and therefore, it is a significant first step for beginners in crypto transactions. During the development of the application, the main criteria were safety considerations, which were combined with ease of use, so that users could comprehend their cryptos and manage them easily.

When one reads the documentation, one will have a grip on the blockchain, public-key cryptography, cryptocurrency, and its wallets, basic concepts of cryptocurrencies, and the basics of technology. This is necessary for every individual to deal with his or her cryptocurrencies safely and effectively. Besides, they will understand the structure of the ETHna and will be able to use it."
LukacsZsombor ,"Datafy - Listen, analyze, and enjoy"," The topic of my thesis is about developing a music-related statistical web application that complements the music listening experience of Spotify users. Today, many people use the Spotify music listening platform, with some people listening to more than 8 hours of music per day. Many people, including myself, got bored of international and national charts and wanted to find new music, but Spotify was not very helpful. That's why I created a web app called ""Datafy"" - a combination of data and Spotify. I chose this name because it mostly reflects how the web app processes Spotify data.

Before developing this project, I looked at similar web applications and realized that most of them lacked a personalized music recommendation system. So, my primary goal was to implement music recommendation properly and also to visually display the user's Spotify statistics.

Kedves David ,Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks," The aim of my thesis is to classify MRI images of brain tumors using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture created with TensorFlow. I also used a pre-trained VGG network applied to the dataset for comparison. The classification task focuses on distinguishing between four categories: gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors, and brain without tumor (healthy). The dataset used consists of 3264 MRI images, which are part of the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge, and which have been preprocessed to improve the quality and consistency of the neural network input data.

I designed and implemented my own model architecture using TensorFlow, with a focus on efficiency and accuracy. To improve model performance and generalization, I applied various pre-processing techniques, including normalization, zero-centering, and data rescaling.

The CNN model was trained and validated on the dataset, and the hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance and as a function of the results. One of the main strengths of my model is that it is small. The final parameter number is 5,897,380.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, I analyzed the results using several metrics, including accuracy, loss functions, ROC-AUC values, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These analyses helped me understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model in classifying different tumor types and how to optimize the parameters.

The final model has achieved promising results, demonstrating its potential to help healthcare professionals in the accurate classification of brain tumors. The overall accuracy obtained with the model in a 5-fold cross-validation is 0.9512% for the 4-class classification problem and 0.9666% for the 3-class classification problem (excluding the tumor-free images) on test data that the model has never seen, i.e., that have not been in either the training or validation phase.

This result highlights the importance of advanced machine learning techniques in medical image analysis and the potential of CNNs in improving the diagnostic accuracy of brain tumor classification."

Portik Johanna Timea ,HIMO: Flatfoot therapy application," Flatfoot is now considered an almost epidemic problem that may develop in any life period. The core of the issue lies in the fact that the arch system has collapsed. Usually, it does not cause any complaints, but sometimes the deformation results in excruciating and musculoskeletal diseases, making timely treatment of flatfoot very important. However, this is often difficult because children need to be very attentive and motivated for regular exercises to be performed correctly and well. Besides, in most cases, there is no possibility for a specialist to control the therapy, which can lead to neglect of treatment.

HIMO (Health In Motion) is a cross-platform Flutter application that offers an innovative solution for adults and children with flatfoot. Through it, users can perform therapeutic treatment in the comfort of their homes. Instead of professional supervision, the application provides monitoring of the exercises in real time and guarantees exercise correctness by giving feedback.

The treatment is supervised through the calibration of the application by the user, with the help of a colored sock. This enables detecting and framing the foot during therapy. Various therapies are offered, and users also have the option to make their personalized therapy plans. The user interface is easy to understand. Guides and descriptions help ensure the correct handling of the application. Interactions with the user facilitate the smooth execution of the therapy.

Thus, the HIMO application ensures effective and convenient treatment of flatfoot, promoting faster recovery and long-term health preservation while saving time and money."
