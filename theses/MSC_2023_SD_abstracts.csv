Albert Arnold,Comparing vertical and horizontal scaling in AWS cloud services,"This thesis was prepared at the request of Webgurus software development company. The aim of the study was to establish a performance benchmark methodology by con- ducting load tests on the target application. The target application was written in PHP using the Laravel framework to examine its performance, scalability, and reliability. We deployed the application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based services as they provided flexible services for conducting the measurements. We needed a user-friendly and research-compliant performance measurement tool. The performance measurement software was deployed in a multi-server application clus- ter, which allowed us to generate sufficient load from multiple computers. This performance measurement tool enabled us to examine the target application’s vertical and horizontal scalability. The results of the experiments clearly showed that while horizontal scaling has several advantages over vertical scaling, both approaches offer significant benefits in application performance. Additionally, we tested the application’s ability to continuously function during a 12-hour stress test. The test results indicated that the application had no memory leaks and could handle high loads without any issues. We concluded that the application had no performance issues and was runnable in a live environment. From an economic standpoint, it became evident that the most suitable server configuration was an application cluster containing 2 or 4 small server instances. "
Albert Brigitta,Application of deep learning algorithms in cancer diagnosis,"The artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, is widely applied technology that plays a crucial role in various fields today. It is becoming increasingly important in the field of medicine as it provides opportunities for the development of diagnostic procedures and early detection of diseases. In the first part of my thesis, I provide a brief overview of artificial intelligence, with a specific focus on convolutional neural networks. I introduce the concepts of classification and image classification, and I also present some deep learning frameworks. In the following chapters, I describe the Kaggle data sets used in my work, which contain microscopic pathological images of cancerous and healthy cells. I then briefly discuss the medical aspects of cancer diagnosis and present the participating classification models and the tests I conducted. In the second part of my thesis, I present the developed web application that enables doctors to manage patients and analyze their examinations. First, I introduce the used frameworks and libraries, and then I detail the user and system requirements, with em- phasis on handling large-sized images. Finally, I showcase the screens of the final product. "
Izsak Andrea,Examining the efficiency and user experience of virtual memory palaces in computer science education,"The purpose of my paper is to inspect the benefits and effects of using virtual memory palace in enhancing students’ experience in teaching informatics. Through the research, the memory palace, the usage of mnemotechniques in creating a virtual walk–based game is presented. The research is based on the construction of the game and its presentation to students, as well as the analysis of the user experience. Positive use experience is vital in the success of interactive products [MS14], and so the feedback was accomplished by using standardized questionnaires. The obtained results have been entered in a personally devised dynamic dashboard to obtain the desired level of visualization of the data. The dashboard is based on Python Flask framework, which allows us to easily obtain a registry based on the data we have gathered. We needed a CSV file that contained the answer bundle of users. The webpage offers multiple filters, using which the results can be visualized based on different regards, and also using different types of diagrams. My work will show the research I have devised and conducted, that has as a main purpose the showing of the efficiency of using memory palace and mnemotechniques in teaching informatics when implementing virtual walk based games to students. The data gathered during the experiment is also shown, and is processed in my work."
Bako Lorand,Comparison of facial liveness detection methods,"The topic of my thesis is the comparison of biometric methods that use the study of human face’s liveness. A person’s face contains features that allow us to clearly determine whether a person is known or unknown to us. As technology and the world evolve, we encounterapplicationsandsystemsthatusefacialrecognitionintheiroperationonadaily basis. However, the use of facial recognition has its own security risks, which require the use of techniques to prevent identity fraud and abuse. Faciallivenesstestingisatechniquethatcanbeusedtodeterminefromafacialimage usedasabiometricdata whether thefiguredisplayed isalivingpersonorit isanon-living representationofaperson,forexamplefromavideo.Humanlifeisincreasinglydependent on elements of the virtual world and thus faces new and previously unknown sources of danger. In addition to establishing the relative position of different organs and identifying specific characteristics, in a well-functioning system, which uses face recognition, it is necessary to implement elements that increase the reliability and safety of the system and thus enhance the user’s sense of security. Within the framework of my thesis, I will attempt to answer the question of which of the methods I have investigated for detecting facial liveness is the most optimal, i.e. which method has the least number of false identifications. On the basis of the measurements made during my research, I will draw conclusions about the cases and circumstances in which the methods I have tested should be used, and the extent to which the use of these methods can provide protection against attacks.

Ballai Tamas,Comparing the performance of microservices-based systems developed with different frameworks,"The topic of my thesis is performance comparison of microservice-based systems, where I implement the same REST API functionality in different programming languages, utilizing suitable frameworks for API development, these being FastAPI, Spring Boot, and Express.js. The microservice architecture has become very popular lately and is starting to replace applications with monolithic architecture. Therefore, many suitable frameworks for developing REST APIs have appeared in various programming languages, one of their main objectives being to facilitate the development of microservice-based systems.

There are many influencing factors when it comes to choosing a framework for developing microservices, for example, how popular it is, how easily it can be learned, whether it is liked by developers, how fast and secure it is. Therefore, it is useful to compare them and see for what purpose a certain application is needed, as the choice is never clear and not always the same framework is the most suitable.

In my thesis, I chose three frameworks and the goal was to monitor and compare the performance of microservice systems developed with them. To compare performance, I selected a few key metrics that cannot be omitted when talking about performance. These are CPU usage and memory consumption, which I monitor with the help of Elastic Stack, as well as response time, throughput, and error rate, which I collect with JMeter. With these frameworks, I develop the same application on an isolated, cloud-based platform, choosing a high-performance computer and using JMeter software to apply load. I set up three different load levels, low, medium, and high. I will compare them to see if the system developed with FastAPI is better or falls short compared to the applications developed with the other two frameworks."
Berecki Zoltan,Approximation algorithms to solve NP-complete problems,"The subject of this paper is Approximation algorithms to solve NP-complete prob- lems using different algorithms. Most of our everyday tasks can be written down in a time diary, which can be the algorithms for our daily tasks. We can rewrite these algorithms into computer programs. Among these, however, there are tasks for which there is no exact formula that can be used to solve a task quickly and accurately. In such cases, we normally look for a solution as close as possible to what is expected, which solves the given situation almost as well. However, it is important not only to get an exact solution, but also to be able to solve these problems quickly enough. Such a task might be, for example, when preparing for a trip, to pack the most important things as quickly as possible, or to plan the shortest route. In such cases, it can be important to consider the issues carefully and it is good to know what methods can be used to solve these tasks quickly and efficiently. In this paper, we will analyse which method should be chosen in order to be able to solve a complete NP task well enough within a given timeframe. For each task, we will present two different algorithms, one that is inefficient and another one that gives an acceptable solution. I solved the same test cases with both algorithms and I have also measured the running time of the algorithms. The averages for these test cases were also calculated. The results are to be interpreted. We will analyze our work and learn from it what methods should be used to solve each type of problem, as well as what programming languages should be used for a further development of these algorithms.

Bacs Balazs,Web application for estimating the carbon footprint,"The topic of this paper is a web application designed to estimate a person’s carbon footprint. We will examine some existing solutions and then I will present how I created the software using various tools. One of the most important problems in our evolving world is carbon dioxide emissions and the resulting climate change. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continues to rise due to human activities. One measure of the harmful impact of these activities on the environment is carbon footprint. This application utilizes the tools of modern web development to help raise awareness among users about the environmental impact of their lifestyles, thereby contributing to the reduction of individual carbon footprints and ultimately to a sustainable future. My goal was to create a browser-based, user-friendly application that allows users to track the carbon emissions of their activities, enabling them to take steps towards optimization. After reviewing similar solutions and relevant studies, I will describe the functioning of the application, some implementation details, potential future improvements, as well as some ethical considerations."
Kovacs Attila,"Comparison of Virtual Machines, Containers and Serverless computing resources in AWS Cloud","My thesis focuses on a comparative analysis of cloud computing resources in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, with a particular focus on applications based on the Microservice architecture. The thesis examines a comparison of the computing resources offered by AWS, which I tested with a custom Microservice-based application system developed specifically for the measurements. In my thesis, I will examine three different levels of AWS services: EC2 (Virtual Ma- chine), ECS (Container) and Lambda (Serverless). I chose these services for comparison because each represents a different computing model: IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), CaaS (Container-as-a-Service), and FaaS (Function-as-a-Service). Iconsideredscalability,performance,cost-effectiveness,flexibilityandmanageability. By comparing and evaluating the results, my goal was to determine which AWS service, EC2, ECS or Lambda, would prove to be the most suitable for a classic application based on a Microservice architecture. Based on the results, I drew conclusions on the selection of the most suitable comput- ing resource and provided guidelines for future developments. My goal with this research was to help AWS users to manage their cloud infrastructure efficiently and to support them in choosing the most suitable computing resources. In addition, my thesis provides an overview of what a classic Microservice architecture-based infrastructure in the cloud looks like, how to manage and maintain infrastructure as code (IaaC), and a basic overview of the most important AWS services and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)."
Makkai Nandor,Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse Application,"Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a field of computer technology that focuses on human-computer interfaces, which allow users to interact with computers in new ways that bypass traditional peripheral devices. Computer vision facilitates the creation of these interfaces by enabling computers to understand their environment by processing digital images. The aim of my thesis is to develop a software application that allows the user to control the mouse functions of a computer by using hand gestures and finger movements. The software includes a face recognition module that ensures that the application will only work if the authorized user’s face is recognized. The application is implemented in Python programming language. I used the OpenCV library for capturing the computer’s camera image and for face recognition, and the MediaPipe package, which provides various machine learning solutions, for hand recognition. "
Fejer Norbert,Deep learning-based diagnostic approaches in medical X-ray image processing,"Recently, we have had to face a severe social problem. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed our society, and we will continue to feel its impact for a long time. Healthcare facilities are struggling with a severe shortage of skilled professionals and outdated methods, highlighting the explicit need for technological innovations that facil- itate and expedite the work of healthcare providers. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and the reliability of convolutional neural networks open up new possibilities in the field of image recognition for the development of systems aimed at diagnosing diseases and providing effective treatments. In my research, I have developed a software package that enables automated diag- nosis on various medical datasets. To achieve this, I examined two different convolutional networks: a custom-designed smaller network (CompactMedNet) and the widely used MobileNet architecture. I evaluated and compared their performance based on various measurements. For this purpose, I utilized publicly available datasets containing brain MRI images and chest X-ray images as well. The main objective of my thesis was to create an architecture that has similar per- formance as larger networks, while being easier to train and interpret. To compare the performance of the networks used in the literature with my own network, I conducted both binary and multi-class classification. The achieved results are promising, and they can be further improved by applying transfer learning techniques. "
Nemeth Franciska,BookShelf,"The aim of my thesis is developing an Android application that helps users digitize their physical library using text recognition by processing an image, and by introducing an artificial intelligence, it helps to implement a book recommender system. There are cases when the physical library is so big, that people don’t know what book is in their library or how many duplicates are there. Therefore, an application like this eases the users book buying habits by using the application’s search engine and the book recommendation system. In this thesis I aim to develop an application that is simple and easy to use and helps to digitize the user’s library. I achieved this with optical character recognition, because it makes it easier to save the book’s data just by taking a picture. The artificial intelligence helps to recommend books that fits to the user’s taste. "
Solyom Botond Ors,AgrOnline - The market of local producers,"The goal of my thesis is to implement an application that establishes a seamless connection between local producers and potential customers. Nowadays, the fact that the world is developing in the direction of digitalization has become evident, so we often come across the concept of digitalization day after day, which can be attributed to the exponential development of technology. Simultaneously with the development of technology, the frequency of the creation of applications and websites also shows an increasing trend, so that, like many other tasks, shopping can also be done in the online space. Thanks to the frequent use of mobile devices, nowadays we can buy almost anything with a few small movements; without much effort or without leaving our homes.

During the creation of this thesis, my goal was to implement an application that works similarly to well-known online shopping applications. However, my intention was to target an area, as a business idea, for which we find fewer examples in general, especially in our environment. During the implementation of the application, my business idea was to target the market of local producers. Based on this, I designed an application that would help local producers to sell their products online as well, but would also be of great help to customers, so that in addition to markets and stores, they can also buy fresh and natural products in the online market at any time, and have access to ingredients and products cultivated and prepared by farmers.

The application was implemented in the Android development environment, utilizing the GPS technology integrated into smartphones that enables positioning. As a result, we get a phone application running on the Android operating system, which represents a unified solution to facilitate the sale and purchase of local products, thereby creating a bridge between these two groups: the members of the local producers and the consumers."
Farkas Andrea Szilvia,Elevator optimisation,"The aim of my thesis is the optimization of elevator systems, the comparison of certain algorithms that can be applied to the problem, the examination of the factors affecting their efficiency, in order to achieve a more optimal result in terms of the time efficiency of elevator systems, by reducing the waiting time. Elevators are part of our everyday life, they can be found in all major buildings. They are means of facilitating and speeding up transportation between floors. There are countless algorithms and approaches for the optimal operation of elevators, some of them are secret, but their basics are known. In my thesis, a couple of algorithms and approaches to solving the problem will be presented. Among the countless available algorithms and approaches, genetic algorithms and approaches using artificial intelligence, and within that, reinforcement learning, will be discussed in detail within this thesis.

I aim to search the answer for the following questions: what is a good approach to optimizing elevator systems, what factors can be the ones that promote the optimal operation of elevators, thereby speeding up the travel, reducing waiting time, and last but not least, they can save energy through their efficiency. In the course of my thesis, a couple of the presented approaches will be implemented and further analysed, based on which the measurements performed will be presented and analysed in detail. The obtained results are compared and evaluated, taking into account the average of several test cases for more accurate results. Finally, based on the results obtained, conclusions are drawn regarding which approach can lead to better results in a given system, and how their operation could possibly be improved even further."
