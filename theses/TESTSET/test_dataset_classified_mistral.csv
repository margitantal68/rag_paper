What are the benefits and challenges of decentralized messaging and data sharing in the digital era?,"[' Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications.\n\nThe traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives.\n\nDecentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed protocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decentralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information.\n\nSimilarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can securely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, decentralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.\n\nWhile decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data authenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.']"," The benefits of decentralized messaging and data sharing include increased privacy, resistance to censorship, and democratization of data control.

What are the benefits of demand forecasting in business environments?,"[' Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many industries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively manage inventory, optimize their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and marketing strategies, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently. It allows companies to minimize stock shortages and overstocks, optimize stock levels, and reduce storage and warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimize design and production processes. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production schedules, and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies to better understand their customers’ needs and behavior. This allows the development of personalized product offerings, the optimization of sales and marketing strategies, and the delivery of a better customer experience. Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Insufficient inventory causes customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, while oversupply is costly in terms of storage and logistics. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect of good demand forecasting.\n\nOver the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand forecasting. The continuous development of forecasting methods and techniques, as well as the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of forecasting. In addition, improvements in data management and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some products by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon Forecast web service.

how deep q-network help ai in games like liar's dice?,"[' Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, because they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy. due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behavior of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents.\n\nFor these reasons, Liar’s Dice is harder to teach to an AI, since neither the opponent’s move nor the game’s current state can be fully known, only roughly determined. But as the game becomes more complex, this becomes an even more demanding process for both human and machine players. In the game, players play with a given number of dice, and each player guesses by bluffing how many of a given number of dice are in play, and then it is essentially up to luck whether his guess is correct.\n\nThis is relatively easy to do with a small number of dice, as there are a finite number of possible moves.

how does password-free secure access work?,"[' In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication.

what is mathematical modeling and how it help in understanding world and making decisions?,"[' Mathematical modeling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using a precise, concise, objective language.

Depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models. They can also be classified as classical or structural models.\n\nTo choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete.

"How is Python utilized in the development of stock trading applications, and what are the key features of the desktop application mentioned in the thesis?","[' One of the most studied sectors in economics and financial analysis is stock trading, where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets. It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries, which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks. The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and minimize risks.\n\nThe fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.\n\nThe thesis consists of two main chapters. In the first chapter, I focus on a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles, and already implemented functionalities. In the second chapter, I introduce two independently developed and separate prediction systems and a third approach resulting from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.\n\nThe aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them, process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using visualization tools. From a program design perspective, I followed the modern principle of allowing for easy expansion and post-development modifications of the application.\n\nThe research section aimed to develop a method capable of providing highly accurate predictions regarding market changes based on past market data and news feeds. These methods were tested, results were documented, compared with each other, and essential conclusions were drawn.\n\nThe social goal of the research is to facilitate safer stock market investments and protect people’s savings, particularly during a period when economic prospects are rather turbulent. In 2022, the average annual inflation in the European Union was 10.4%, in Hungary 24.5%, and in Romania 14.1%. In contrast, the average annual deposit interest rates in Hungary were 6.1%, and in Romania, they reached 7.2%.']"," Python is used in the development of stock trading applications for creating sophisticated algorithms, automating data processing, and building user interfaces.

What does Kóditt offer for high schoolers?,"[' The goal of the Kóditt platform is to offer exercises for high schoolers and first-year university students who want to acquire the basics of software engineering. At the same time, its second goal is to help improve and deepen the algorithmic thinking of students who pass the difficulty levels of the occurring exercises. In the XXI century, a beginner software engineer faces the fact that if they want to learn the basics of software engineering autonomously, they must first decide which programming language to choose.

What is the significance of the year 2000 in MRI histogram normalization?,"[' The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is its lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be interpreted in the context in which they appear. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other. In other words, they need a normalization. The most popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al. in 2000. This method aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternatively, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with this method.\n\nThis thesis proposes to investigate which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques. And which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI datasets are involved in the investigation: one without and the other with focal lesions.

Dynamic programming is used in optimization, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students. Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems and by solving these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples and practical applications, allowing them to see how dynamic programming can assist them in various areas of life, such as data analysis or video game development.\n\nBy incorporating unique interactive exercises and creative approaches, you pique students\' interest and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fosters the development of their creativity, logical thinking, and ability to work in teams. The goal of my paper is to present dynamic programming as comprehensively and uniquely as possible, thereby capturing students’ attention and laying the foundation for their future IT skills.\n\nI aimed to achieve this through a website, primarily because it is easily accessible and applicable to anyone. Furthermore, it was crucial for the visualization to be carried out through tasks that perfectly reflect the fundamental properties of the algorithm, such as dividing problems into subproblems and memoization. Additionally, I strived to create a user-friendly interface where the visualization speed can also be adjusted.']"," Dynamic programming is applied in computer graphics by using it for efficient solution of recursive problems that frequently occur in areas like image rendering, geometric modeling, and motion planning.

"Could you explain how Android applications can utilize pixel sorting methods to create glitch effects, and what challenges might arise in implementing these methods?","[' The topic of my paper is to examine and recreate pixel sorting methods within an Android application. There are a lot of possibilities to edit and correct our images, either with difficult image editing programs or with simple filters, with a click. To get the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods. Generally, you have to dispose of editorial knowledge, and it is a time-consuming operation. At present, there are few applications where you can apply this method simply and rapidly.\n\nThe glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from the same method due to the fact that every image is different. So, we cannot know what we achieve until we try the method on the given image. In addition, it belongs to such an area which is developing in our days and can be developed also by ourselves, given that there are a lot of possibilities, and the limits to create these methods are only what you can imagine.\n\nOn preparing my paper, I designed an application by means of which we can edit our images easily and simply, by the help of different glitch filters for pixel sorting. Behind the filters applied on our images, different pixel sorting algorithms make it possible within the application to achieve the desired effect. Each filter is sorting the pixels under well-defined conditions and criteria so that the effect should be as aesthetic as possible.\n\nIt was a challenge to find such methods which can work quickly also with a higher pixel number. Besides, it was important to experiment with those methods which not only sort but also modify the pixels on the image so that one can achieve a spectacular, aesthetic and pleasing effect.

This is because there is no system yet which is able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interesting topic because with such a system, there would be no need anymore to recognize images or audio nor any cookie checking, like how Google bot detection works.

I will illustrate them, examine what kind of features I could extract from them to classify users more precisely. Then, try some method to generate synthetic mouse movement data sets similar to humans in order to deceive bot detectors.

what adobe after effects do?,"[' This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user-friendly mathematical animation software. The primary objective was to create a tool that simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student satisfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance.\n\nDespite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging. They often require hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere Pro. These tools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform-specific, limiting accessibility.\n\nTo address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations.\n\nInitially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users.\n\nAniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries. The software’s architecture was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features.\n\nKey features include a timeline-based editing interface, support for various mathematical objects such as points, lines, vectors, and functions, and export capabilities in multiple formats. The development process was thoroughly documented, and a promotional website was created to showcase the software’s capabilities.\n\nThe final product offers a powerful yet simple solution for creating high-quality mathematical visualizations, addressing a gap in the existing software landscape. AniMathIO also aims to be platform-independent, providing a desktop application that can be used on various operating systems. This ensures broader accessibility and usability.\n\nThe software combines the ease of traditional video editing software with the capabilities of advanced mathematical animation tools, making it an invaluable resource for mathematics educators and learners alike.']"," Adobe After Effects is a specialized software used for creating visual effects and motion graphics for video post-production.

How does measuring the time spent on sports photos enhance the effectiveness of a personalized content recommendation system?,"["" I chose the personalized content recommendation system of websites as the topic of my thesis, because user experience and unique content are essential for successful websites. A personalized content recommendation system allows users to access content that is relevant to their interests. This can increase time spent on this site, improve return rates, and build a deeper relationship with the site. The benefits of personalized content recommendation include a unique user experience, increased relevance of content, and increased user satisfaction. The system takes into account users' browsing history and habits, using different algorithms to provide them with more accurate recommendations. This makes it easier for users to find content that matches their interests and discover new things.\n\nMy thesis presents a website with images by category.

Therefore, a content recommendation system full of images are an excellent opportunity to capture the interest of users in an entertaining way.\n\nMy content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images. Measuring time spent on images can help to increase the effectiveness of content recommendation. If users spend more time looking at or exploring images, it may indicate that the content is interesting or attractive to them. This information allows the system to draw conclusions about users' preferences and tastes.

How does a personalized content recommendation system enhance user experience on websites?,"["" I chose the personalized content recommendation system of websites as the topic of my thesis, because user experience and unique content are essential for successful websites. A personalized content recommendation system allows users to access content that is relevant to their interests. This can increase time spent on this site, improve return rates, and build a deeper relationship with the site. The benefits of personalized content recommendation include a unique user experience, increased relevance of content, and increased user satisfaction. The system takes into account users' browsing history and habits, using different algorithms to provide them with more accurate recommendations. This makes it easier for users to find content that matches their interests and discover new things.\n\nMy thesis presents a website with images by category. I have chosen to do this because I find the role of images on this type of website extremely important in attracting attention. Images are attractive and quickly grab the attention of users. Therefore, a content recommendation system full of images is an excellent opportunity to capture the interest of users in an entertaining way.\n\nMy content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images.

What is the Nash equilibrium in the context of two-person games?,"["" In a two-person game, the purpose of both players is obviously to win by following the rules and regulations. Therefore, each player resorts to the strategy that results in their greatest benefit. However, there are games where if one player applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, the set of strategy in which neither player can increase their profit by changing their strategy, if their opponent doesn't change their strategy, is called the Nash equilibrium point.\n\nIn my thesis, the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, both mathematically and from a programming perspective, using the prisoner's dilemma problem. Additionally, I will cover the following topics: the introduction of basic game theory concepts, the prisoner's dilemma, the presentation of an applied algorithm, and the interpretation of the result.\n\nTo compute this equilibrium point, I apply the Lemke-Howson algorithm. For visualization of the obtained equilibrium point, I use Python as my programming language. The goals also include introducing the reader to the world of game theory and helping users with average mathematical and information technology skills understand the Nash equilibrium.""]"," The Nash equilibrium in the context of two-person games refers to the set of strategies where no player can increase their profit if their opponent doesn't change their strategy.

How does ADAS benefit from image recognition technologies?,"["" In my thesis, I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays, there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations.\n\nRecent innovations rely frequently on image recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication, and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture's pixel values, we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas.\n\nIn order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy, this can lead to image recognition.\n\nIn order to achieve this, there is a need for the development of fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms. In this work, I am comparing different distance metrics for the computation of similarities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan, and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images.\n\nIn all the cases, I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-written digits and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean, and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies.\n\nI will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing distance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). At the conference, I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of the technology.""]"," Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly benefit from image recognition technologies as they enable features like lane departure warnings, automatic emergency braking, and pedestrian detection, thus improving road safety by assisting drivers in hazardous situations.","Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) benefit from image recognition technologies by utilizing recent innovations in this field to enhance their functionality.

With a unified interface where everything can be easily managed, as each company has its own preferences, these can only be maximally satisfied with an application that can be easily personalized.\n\nThe aim of my thesis is to create a mobile application that can be integrated with a web-based ERP system. This helps companies track the work done by employees and facilitate communication, both in the form of messages and documents. The foundation of the web system is an Odoo framework-based website, where management has been handled up to now.\n\nHowever, they couldn't accurately account for the work done, and employees had to log in to the website to send a message or attach a document to a completed task. This led to the idea of greatly simplifying and enhancing the workflow with an application where employees can do all this without needing to connect to the website from their phones.\n\nTo implement this, I developed a native Android application using Kotlin. I utilized a local Room database and connected it via XMLRPC to the web interface where data is stored in PostgreSQL. I also had to create a module for the web interface, acting as an API between the Odoo system and my application.

These data greatly influence the future possibilities of students, whether it's about career opportunities or further education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools.\n\nVisualizing these results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of teaching programs. In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience, which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set.\n\nI felt the need to develop such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays. I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency and normalization for future use.\n\nThe user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations.

Many want to develop competitively, but most persons play logic games for pleasure. The main purpose of logic games is the development of intellectual abilities and the useful and valuable use of free time. My goal in this work is to create software that includes a logic game.

Who is Sebastian Sager and what is his connection to optimal control?,"["" Our world is highly complex, thus there are a lot of problems which we are not able to control. But the most dynamic systems can be written with mathematical equations, therefore we have some control over the system's behavior. The most frequently used method for this purpose is optimal control. With optimal control, we can solve the most linear and nonlinear problems that affect our everyday lives. The importance of this strategy speaks for itself, since it not only achieves results at an economic level (see Sebastian Sager [1]), but also saves human lives. For instance, the Dengue-fever was stopped in the 1960s: the disease's system can be written with a set of nonlinear differential equations, in which an educational campaign was also involved (see [2]).

How does the REST API function within the system for recognizing violence in homes using camera footage?,"["" Personal safety is playing an increasingly important role every day. As a result, the topic of my dissertation was the recognition of violence in homes using camera footages. The established system detects dangerous and violent scenes using its built-in artificial intelligence module and then notifies the appropriate person. Besides that, the system performs space surveillance and intrusion control. Additionally, it's scanning for violence detection. This module takes the use of surveillance cameras to a new level. So, if abnormal events occur, it will notify the user as quickly as possible so that they can react quickly to adverse events. The notification process is the top priority, as it notifies the user of events only if the system has been designed to do so if there is actually a problem. For the implementation and operation of these functionalities, the android phone application provides a suitable environment. We will use artificial intelligence methods to examine what is happening in a variety of ways, including sound and image-based evaluations, to determine what is happening on the camera and then calculate the hazard factor.

"How does the developed application simplify web testing, and what specific advantages does it offer compared to existing solutions?","["" The subject of my thesis is the creation of an application that makes it possible to test web pages with ease using a graphical interface. The objective is to make it easy for users to test the correct behavior of their websites without requiring them to learn new testing libraries.\n\nThe application enables users to implement end-to-end web tests in just a few minutes. I managed to implement a product that makes the web testing process 90% faster and 70% cheaper than the most used products on the market.\n\nThe application is built based on a Software-as-a-Service model. The product is not the graphical interface itself, but the automated testing system behind it. The sole purpose of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is to create a better user experience and make the application available and usable for a larger audience.\n\nThe graphical interface is a desktop application implemented using Electron, a technology that embeds a website inside a desktop software. This can be installed and used on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. By doing this, we can have a product with high cross-platform compatibility and the ability to test local websites at the same time.\n\nThe application communicates with a server, which is responsible for project and user data management. This way, users can have the same exact experience from any device they access the application from. The server-side application is written in TypeScript using the Express.js framework inside Node.js. The client-side application was created using Electron, which embeds a Next.js website written in TypeScript into itself.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned technologies, both applications use third-party libraries and tools. In my thesis, I go into detail about the problems in the IT sector that I'm trying to fix with my application. I also talk about the direction that the application needs to be developed towards so it can become an industry standard with time.""]"," The developed application simplifies web testing by providing an easy-to-use graphical interface that allows users to implement end-to-end tests in a few minutes, making it 90% faster and 70% cheaper than existing solutions.

what ecological footprint mean in this context?,"["" The topic of my research paper is the comparison of store prices: stores versus chain stores, based on shopping cart value. In this fast-paced and modern world, there's no time to read catalogs and brochures to compare prices. The problem is that there's a significant variance for the same shopping cart between stores and chain stores. Yet, there's a pressing need to address this issue because everyone's time is equally precious. The thematic concept is also justified by my personal experience. As a college boarding student, I had to be mindful of prices and where to buy the same products. Additionally, the ecological footprint of catalogs and brochures should not be overlooked.\n\nThe aim of my project is to develop a system that enables users to obtain quotes from various stores and chain stores, sorted by location and cart value (priorities in shopping), simply by assembling their shopping cart (a necessity). We will shop at all the stores and chain stores in the country, then purchase the chosen products from the store or chain store with the best results for us.\n\nThe project consists of three main components: a server (which hosts the website and android application), a website (for stores and store chains), and an android application (for end-users). Our goal is to create a modern system that meets today's standards, offering users a convenient, user-friendly, beautiful, and clear interface.\n\nTo illustrate the problem and proposed solution, I created the server and android application.

What is Flutter used for in mobile app development?,"["" The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in an efficient, fast, and secure way. People often find themselves in situations where they need help quickly, especially with health issues. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn't know where to go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context.\n\nAs we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist. However, for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and appointments on paper. Similarly, well-functioning applications in Romania are only used by larger clinics. Moreover, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts.\n\nTherefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.\n\nThe backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real-time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data.\n\nBut how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients but also to create a useful interface for doctors. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient.\n\nIn addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above. The app not only facilitates contact and communication but can even increase the speed of effective patient care.""]"," In the given context, Flutter is used for mobile app development as it allows fast and efficient development of applications for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.",Flutter is an open-source framework for mobile application development that allows fast and efficient development for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.,1.0,0.9999999999999997,0.9326181809595615,0.7331545452398902

How have computer programs and algorithms changed the game of chess since the Middle Ages?,"["" Throughout history, only a few things, apart from minor improvements, have remained almost unchanged from the early Middle Ages to our present times and represent the same board game for millions of people. It has no hidden parts or any elements of chance; everything is in front of the two players from the beginning to the checkmate. Despite this, one of the biggest changes brought to chess came from the programs and algorithms created by computer scientists over the past decades. These offered a deeper insight into the world of chess, calculating the best moves from any given position, from an unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole new dimension of depth since we could analyze every single detail, and the most optimal strategy could be generated in mere seconds.\n\nWith my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to solve chess problems and puzzles that even thousands of years ago could have occupied people. My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess' complexity, is to clarify these algorithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.\n\nMy chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways.
