What are the benefits and challenges of decentralized messaging and data sharing in the digital era?,"[' Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications.\n\nThe traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives.\n\nDecentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed protocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decentralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information.\n\nSimilarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can securely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, decentralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.\n\nWhile decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data authenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.']","**Benefits of Decentralized Messaging and Data Sharing:**

how deep q-network help ai in games like liar's dice?,"[' Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, because they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy. due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behavior of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents.\n\nFor these reasons, Liar’s Dice is harder to teach to an AI, since neither the opponent’s move nor the game’s current state can be fully known, only roughly determined.

what is mathematical modeling and how it help in understanding world and making decisions?,"[' Mathematical modeling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding, quantifying the impact of different changes on a system, and can also help to make tactical and strategic decisions.\n\nModels can be classified according to different aspects. Depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models. They can also be classified as classical or structural models.\n\nTo choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete. The modeling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, analysis, testing, and application.\n\nProblems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated.\n\nMathematical modeling came to the fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gauss, and A.J. Nicholson.\n\nIn my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the specified model: the integral method, the log-integral method, where I will use the Lotka-Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species; and finally, I will try to improve the results by particle swarm optimization.

It aids in scientific understanding by providing structured analysis and informs decision-making through predictive models.

The process involves four stages: construction (defining variables and equations), analysis (solving these to predict outcomes), testing (validating against real data), and application (using insights for decisions). These stages are iterative, meaning if changes occur after any stage, adjustments may be necessary before re-testing. This ensures the model remains accurate and relevant.

"How is Python utilized in the development of stock trading applications, and what are the key features of the desktop application mentioned in the thesis?","[' One of the most studied sectors in economics and financial analysis is stock trading, where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets. It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries, which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks. The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and minimize risks.\n\nThe fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.\n\nThe thesis consists of two main chapters. In the first chapter, I focus on a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles, and already implemented functionalities. In the second chapter, I introduce two independently developed and separate prediction systems and a third approach resulting from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.\n\nThe aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them, process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using visualization tools.

In the XXI century, a beginner software engineer faces the fact that if they want to learn the basics of software engineering autonomously, they must first decide which programming language to choose. The first step in this process is to search for websites that can help them theoretically and practically. In most cases, if you want to reach these sites in Hungarian, you will not get any results.

What is the significance of the year 2000 in MRI histogram normalization?,"[' The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is its lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be interpreted in the context in which they appear. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other. In other words, they need a normalization. The most popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al. in 2000. This method aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternatively, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with this method.\n\nThis thesis proposes to investigate which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques. And which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI datasets are involved in the investigation: one without and the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation, we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more than five milestones that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.']","The year 2000 is significant because it marks the introduction of the histogram normalization algorithm by Nyúl et al., which has been utilized in their study to evaluate its effectiveness compared to other methods for brain MRI segmentation.",The year 2000 is significant because it is when Nyúl et al. proposed a popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation.,1.0,0.9131315639467018,0.9827391612000805,0.8885419331571629

Furthermore, so far there has been no online collection of tasks in Hungarian that provides help to those who do not have adequate foreign language skills.\n\nThis is how I came up with the idea to create a web-based application that is easy to access and use for anyone with internet access. The system is simple yet efficient, with many expansion options, and can be easily adapted to the needs of teachers and students.\n\nBoth students and teachers can register for the app. Each student can join a class created by their teacher and then complete dozens of assignments created or uploaded by either their own teacher or other teachers. The solutions developed and uploaded by the student can be easily evaluated by the lead teacher, and their effective development can be promoted with his suggestions.\n\nAlthough it was very difficult to start, I am pleased to know that I finally achieved my primary goals to create a web application suitable for solving and evaluating competition-level tasks.

To get the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods. Generally, you have to dispose of editorial knowledge, and it is a time-consuming operation. At present, there are few applications where you can apply this method simply and rapidly.\n\nThe glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from the same method due to the fact that every image is different. So, we cannot know what we achieve until we try the method on the given image.

Cross-platform development tools offer several advantages, including a reduced learning curve as they allow developers to use a single codebase across multiple platforms. However, these tools may not optimize performance as effectively on a specific platform like Android compared to native development, which is tailored for that platform, ensuring better performance and efficiency in the development process. Native Android app development requires learning about Android's architecture and tools separately, which can be time-consuming but results in more optimized code with better porting capabilities once set up. Cross-platform approaches may also lead to larger codebases, potentially increasing costs due to redundancy across platforms. In summary, cross-platform offers quicker initial development with a lower learning curve but may lack the performance and efficiency of native apps on specific platforms.

what adobe after effects do?,"[' This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user-friendly mathematical animation software. The primary objective was to create a tool that simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student satisfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance.\n\nDespite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging. They often require hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere Pro. These tools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform-specific, limiting accessibility.\n\nTo address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations.\n\nInitially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users.\n\nAniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries.

What is the Nash equilibrium in the context of two-person games?,"["" In a two-person game, the purpose of both players is obviously to win by following the rules and regulations. Therefore, each player resorts to the strategy that results in their greatest benefit. However, there are games where if one player applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, the set of strategy in which neither player can increase their profit by changing their strategy, if their opponent doesn't change their strategy, is called the Nash equilibrium point.\n\nIn my thesis, the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, both mathematically and from a programming perspective, using the prisoner's dilemma problem. Additionally, I will cover the following topics: the introduction of basic game theory concepts, the prisoner's dilemma, the presentation of an applied algorithm, and the interpretation of the result.\n\nTo compute this equilibrium point, I apply the Lemke-Howson algorithm.

How does ADAS benefit from image recognition technologies?,"["" In my thesis, I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays, there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations.\n\nRecent innovations rely frequently on image recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication, and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture's pixel values, we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas.\n\nIn order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy, this can lead to image recognition.\n\nIn order to achieve this, there is a need for the development of fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms. In this work, I am comparing different distance metrics for the computation of similarities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan, and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images.\n\nIn all the cases, I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-written digits and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean, and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies.\n\nI will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing distance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022).

How can anonymous feedback help teachers improve their teeching methods?,"["" The aim of my thesis is to analyze anonymous feedback to draw the right conclusions regarding a given topic. In real life, we often need feedback to make the right decisions and changes for the future. Anonymous feedback gives a more clear picture about reality than not anonymous feedback because it's in human nature that we don't give honest feedback or don't give feedback at all when its content is negative. For instance, when a teacher expects feedback from his/her students about the quality of lessons and teaching methods. In such situations, it's really important for people to get realistic feedback to learn, improve, and make the right conclusions. In this project, a user-friendly and efficient software was implemented which allows collecting, analyzing, and visualizing anonymous feedback. An initial version of this application was published at the beginning of this semester to allow for a case study. Therefore, students applying for the Object-oriented programming course had the opportunity to give anonymous feedback. The application allows registered users to create topics for which they request anonymous feedbacks. Within a topic, questions can be formulated to motivate participants for feedback. Feedbacks are collected, analyzed, and visualized using word clouds.""]","Anonymous feedback allows teachers to gather honest and detailed insights from students without fear of negative self-censorship, enabling them to identify improvements in teaching methods through structured analysis of collected feedback data.","Anonymous feedback provides a clearer picture of reality because people tend to be more honest when their identity is not revealed.

how do programming techniques help in making a software tool for learning algorithms?,"["" The computer science gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the beauty of algorithms. As a beginner, we write and test short codes and browse the implementation of famous algorithms, learning about their logic's beauty. During our studies, we are quickly introduced to basic ordering algorithms and graph theory. While dissecting the ordering algorithms, an interesting question arose, and the answer was obtained by looking at an emerging problem from a graph-theoretic point of view. The problem led us to start investigating ordering algorithms using graph theory. This led me to develop a software tool to investigate algorithms using graph theory. In this thesis, I present the process of developing an algorithm testing software tool using different programming techniques. The paper includes the theoretical background, design and implementation of the software tool. The tool will be useful for novice programmers and for enthusiastic individuals too who want to gain insight into basic ordering algorithms and other small pieces of code by using graphs. The tool can be used as a teaching aid, as it facilitates the understanding of the algorithm, and can also be used in teaching graph theory.""]","Programming techniques enhance the development of an algorithm learning tool by:

1. **Organizing Code**: Structuring code (modules/classes) improves readability and maintainability, aiding users in understanding algorithms step-by-step.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details allows users to focus on essential features without overwhelming them with implementation complexities.
3. **Testing & Debugging**: Facilitates error detection early, crucial for learning algorithm logic effectively.
4. **Version Control**: Tools like Git enable efficient updates and collaboration, allowing the addition of new features or bug fixes incrementally.

"What are the two types of documents that the application in the project is designed to digitize, and how does the software handle each type of document after it is uploaded?","["" The goal of my project is to create an application that makes digitizing documents easier. Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and institutions. My application can be used to digitize two kinds of documents: scanned paper documents and sound files. The software extracts data from each uploaded document, resulting in a computerized text file. Before saving the data from the document, it extracts entities (people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Additionally, it creates a summary of the text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text.\n\nThe other important function of the software is browsing documents. Users can search for, view, and download documents uploaded by other users. When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art software.\n\nThe software is made up of two parts: an Angular application on the client's end and a REST API on the server's end.

What is the Rubik's Cube and how has technology made it easier to solve?,"["" The Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most iconic and most interesting puzzle games. The first Rubik's Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a Hungarian architect, sculptor, and game designer. Since its inception, it has become popular worldwide, entertaining millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik's Cube demands attention, patience, and strategic thinking from its user. But thanks to improvements in modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.\n\nThanks to improvements in our smart devices and automated robots, solving the Rubik's Cube has reached new levels. These days, Rubik's Cube solver applications are available on personal computers and smartphones, making the learning of new solving algorithms a lot easier.\n\nUsually, an application like this shows a 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution and show it to the user. The user can copy these steps onto his or her own cube, this way helping him or her develop his or her own skills.\n\nUsually, it's a plus if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the cube more. My software is able to read in a real cube using the camera of a smart device, this way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, which he or she can go through step by step, or if he or she feels like it, he or she can try to solve the cube himself or herself.\n\nAside from this, I wanted to implement a feature where the user can learn given solving algorithms. For this reason, there is a separate menu where the user can choose a solving algorithm and can see its steps on the cube. The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution, I used Kociemba's two-step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well-liked for its speed and low solution step count.""]","The Rubik's Cube is a puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik. It consists of a 3x3 cube with colored stickers on each face, which can be twisted to scramble the colors.

In this fast-paced and modern world, there's no time to read catalogs and brochures to compare prices. The problem is that there's a significant variance for the same shopping cart between stores and chain stores. Yet, there's a pressing need to address this issue because everyone's time is equally precious. The thematic concept is also justified by my personal experience. As a college boarding student, I had to be mindful of prices and where to buy the same products. Additionally, the ecological footprint of catalogs and brochures should not be overlooked.\n\nThe aim of my project is to develop a system that enables users to obtain quotes from various stores and chain stores, sorted by location and cart value (priorities in shopping), simply by assembling their shopping cart (a necessity).

What is Flutter used for in mobile app development?,"["" The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in an efficient, fast, and secure way. People often find themselves in situations where they need help quickly, especially with health issues. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn't know where to go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context.\n\nAs we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist. However, for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and appointments on paper. Similarly, well-functioning applications in Romania are only used by larger clinics. Moreover, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts.\n\nTherefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.\n\nThe backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real-time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data.\n\nBut how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients but also to create a useful interface for doctors. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient.\n\nIn addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above.

How have computer programs and algorithms changed the game of chess since the Middle Ages?,"["" Throughout history, only a few things, apart from minor improvements, have remained almost unchanged from the early Middle Ages to our present times and represent the same board game for millions of people. It has no hidden parts or any elements of chance; everything is in front of the two players from the beginning to the checkmate. Despite this, one of the biggest changes brought to chess came from the programs and algorithms created by computer scientists over the past decades. These offered a deeper insight into the world of chess, calculating the best moves from any given position, from an unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole new dimension of depth since we could analyze every single detail, and the most optimal strategy could be generated in mere seconds.\n\nWith my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to solve chess problems and puzzles that even thousands of years ago could have occupied people. My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess' complexity, is to clarify these algorithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.\n\nMy chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways. In a given example, they choose the best moves by analyzing the current situation or find a solution by testing all possible cases. By saving running times, I tried to present the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing ways with the help of the most effective methods.\n\nLast but not least, popularizing chess and arousing interest in it for others was another goal of mine since anyone can be an expert of the game of kings, and similar programs can help a lot in mastering it.""]","Since the Middle Ages, computer programs and algorithms have revolutionized chess by automating complex strategic analysis.

What is the role of artificial intelligence in a 2D platformer game?,"["" Using computers is now an integral part of our lives, and we use them for many things. Whether it's to do our work at work or at home as a recreational tool, such as browsing the web, listening to music, watching a film, or even playing games. Video games have gained immense popularity over the last decade. People like to sit down and play a game in their free time, either with friends or against a computer. The computer is expected to be as natural and smart as possible, making the game more enjoyable. As it can also provide a challenge to the user. This is why many game development companies are trying to put more advanced and smarter artificial intelligence into their games.\n\nThe aim of my thesis is to create an artificial intelligence for a 2D platformer game that can entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior. By complex behavior, we mean the following: if the opponent has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, the opponent should patrol. If the opponent has noticed the player, then the opponent should chase the player or attack the player if they are close enough.\n\nTo increase the intelligence of the AI, the A\\* path search algorithm will play a major role. This will optimally determine the shortest route between the player and the opponent. The opponent will chase the user-controlled character along that route.\n\nTo implement the game, we used the Unity game engine. We also loaded the A\\* Pathfinding Project plugin to apply the A\\* pathfinding algorithm.""]","The role of artificial intelligence in a 2D platformer game is to enhance gameplay by creating strategic interactions: the AI determines patrol routes when patrolling and chases/attacks players when close, adding depth and challenge.

What role did Târgu Mures play in the testing of the LearnIT application?,"["" With the rise of digitalization, the use of mobile devices have become a key enabler for today's young people, and there is a growing demand for interactive learning tools. The aim of my thesis is to present a quiz-based learning application that we have developed, which tries to put the time spent on the phone to good use. The main goal of the LearnIT application is to learn concepts related to different programming languages through interactive elements. Particular attention is paid to interactive quizzes that allow users to actively participate in the learning process. The application also has a teaching interface that allows the creation of new courses and questions. This allows teachers to personalize the course material and adapt it to the needs of the students, making learning even more effective.\n\nAfter the implementation of the application, I was able to carry out an experiment consisting of two parts: a test of the application I developed and a follow-up survey. The testing of the application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures, Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania. Using the application, the participants filled in different quizzes for several weeks in parallel with the educational material, and their answers were recorded using a scoring system defined by me. After testing, I processed a total of 25 students’ responses, almost 750 answers.\n\nThe answers and scores thus collected were examined. In contrast, the poll was designed to collect the subjective opinions of the participants. In this case, a total of 51 responses were processed. The results show that users had a positive experience, as reflected in the data and scores collected during the use of the application, as well as in the opinions expressed in the questionnaire.""]",The role of Târgu Mures in testing the LearnIT application was as a host institution where participating students from the Faculty of Târgu Mures used the application alongside their educational material during an experiment.,"The testing of the LearnIT application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures, Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania.",0.6666666666666666,0.9919887859994011,0.9394949318440884,0.4848737329610221
