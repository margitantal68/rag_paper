How can a Time Tracker function without user input on a personal computer?,"[' A Time Tracker is a system or software that keeps track of the activities the user spends their time on. Many use these for various purposes, including personal improvement and keeping track of billable hours. however, such systems rely on user input and are thus prone to user errors.

Using this data, a neural network can be trained to place time spans spent at the computer into user-defined activity categories. This new generated data can then be the subject of further statistical analysis.']"," A Time Tracker function could automatically monitor usage of different applications (shards) and log hits (interactions or actions taken) to track time spent without requiring user input, by using system-level timers.

What are the benefits and challenges of decentralized messaging and data sharing in the digital era?,"[' Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications.\n\nThe traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives.\n\nDecentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed protocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decentralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information.\n\nSimilarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can securely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, decentralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.\n\nWhile decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data authenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.']"," Benefits: Decentralized messaging and data sharing offer resilience and fault tolerance as they are distributed across multiple nodes (_shards), reducing the chance of a single point of failure (e.g., servers timing out or being taken offline). This decentralization also helps maintain privacy and security by eliminating centralized control points that could be vulnerable to attacks.

Challenges: Decentralization may lead to lower performance due to increased latency, as messages and data need to be transmitted across a network of nodes rather than a central server (hits). Additionally, achieving consensus among distributed nodes can be complex and time-consuming, potentially leading to delays or timed-out transactions. Decentralized systems also face the challenge of ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing forks in the system's data chain.","Decentralized messaging and data sharing offer several benefits in the digital era, including greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server.

What are the benefits of demand forecasting in business environments?,"[' Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many industries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively manage inventory, optimize their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and marketing strategies, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently. It allows companies to minimize stock shortages and overstocks, optimize stock levels, and reduce storage and warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimize design and production processes. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production schedules, and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies to better understand their customers’ needs and behavior. This allows the development of personalized product offerings, the optimization of sales and marketing strategies, and the delivery of a better customer experience. Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Insufficient inventory causes customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, while oversupply is costly in terms of storage and logistics. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect of good demand forecasting.\n\nOver the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand forecasting. The continuous development of forecasting methods and techniques, as well as the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of forecasting. In addition, improvements in data management and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some products by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon Forecast web service.

how deep q-network help ai in games like liar's dice?,"[' Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, because they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy. due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behavior of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents.\n\nFor these reasons, Liar’s Dice is harder to teach to an AI, since neither the opponent’s move nor the game’s current state can be fully known, only roughly determined. But as the game becomes more complex, this becomes an even more demanding process for both human and machine players. In the game, players play with a given number of dice, and each player guesses by bluffing how many of a given number of dice are in play, and then it is essentially up to luck whether his guess is correct.\n\nThis is relatively easy to do with a small number of dice, as there are a finite number of possible moves.

what is mathematical modeling and how it help in understanding world and making decisions?,"[' Mathematical modeling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding, quantifying the impact of different changes on a system, and can also help to make tactical and strategic decisions.\n\nModels can be classified according to different aspects. Depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models. They can also be classified as classical or structural models.\n\nTo choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete. The modeling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, analysis, testing, and application.\n\nProblems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated.\n\nMathematical modeling came to the fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gauss, and A.J. Nicholson.\n\nIn my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the specified model: the integral method, the log-integral method, where I will use the Lotka-Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species; and finally, I will try to improve the results by particle swarm optimization.

The number of hits could represent the frequency or count of these observations. Taking, for instance, would refer to collecting these data points over time, while timed_out could indicate that certain data collection attempts were unsuccessful or failed to complete within a specified timeframe.

"How is Python utilized in the development of stock trading applications, and what are the key features of the desktop application mentioned in the thesis?","[' One of the most studied sectors in economics and financial analysis is stock trading, where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets. It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries, which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks. The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and minimize risks.\n\nThe fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.\n\nThe thesis consists of two main chapters. In the first chapter, I focus on a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles, and already implemented functionalities. In the second chapter, I introduce two independently developed and separate prediction systems and a third approach resulting from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.\n\nThe aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them, process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using visualization tools. From a program design perspective, I followed the modern principle of allowing for easy expansion and post-development modifications of the application.\n\nThe research section aimed to develop a method capable of providing highly accurate predictions regarding market changes based on past market data and news feeds. These methods were tested, results were documented, compared with each other, and essential conclusions were drawn.\n\nThe social goal of the research is to facilitate safer stock market investments and protect people’s savings, particularly during a period when economic prospects are rather turbulent. In 2022, the average annual inflation in the European Union was 10.4%, in Hungary 24.5%, and in Romania 14.1%. In contrast, the average annual deposit interest rates in Hungary were 6.1%, and in Romania, they reached 7.2%.']"," In stock trading applications, Python is utilized due to its flexibility, extensive libraries, and strong community support for financial data analysis and algorithmic trading. While the given reference context does not specify the exact features of a desktop application mentioned in the thesis, we can infer that it may involve:

2. Timing functions to take trades at optimal moments: Libraries like NumPy and SciPy offer time-series analysis and optimization capabilities.
3.

This is also confirmed by the evaluation of the answers to the pre-test questions: it may be useful to create a platform that can ensure the verification and correctness of code written in several programming languages. An added benefit of this platform may be that the requirements of the tasks are formulated in Hungarian. As the saying goes, “even Rome was not built in a day,” so the Kóditt platform is setting off on the road to its final destination with small steps. Currently, the Kóditt platform seeks to guide students from simple tasks to complex ones using the C++ programming language. The use of foreign languages on these kinds of platforms takes me back to my high school memories, reminding me of the many difficulties I had to deal with when I came across the phrasing of software engineering and math tasks in a foreign language. Kóditt thus provides a solution for Hungarian students to learn the basics of software engineering by practicing basic tasks that are automatically corrected by the implemented software.']", I don't know.

What is the significance of the year 2000 in MRI histogram normalization?,"[' The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is its lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be interpreted in the context in which they appear. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other. In other words, they need a normalization. The most popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al. in 2000. This method aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternatively, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with this method.\n\nThis thesis proposes to investigate which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques. And which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI datasets are involved in the investigation: one without and the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation, we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more than five milestones that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.']"," I don't have specific information indicating a significant event related to MRI histogram normalization in the year 2000 using the provided reference contexts.

There may even be a situation where, knowing that two tasks are planned very close in time, a person may not be able to complete or show up for both, and the logical decision is to decide based on importance and priority, which one of the two tasks the person should show up for and which one they will complete. An appropriate software that can take priority into account can also help in this case. In this dissertation, I am looking for a solution to the problem of what type of software should be implemented so that a given person can monitor the effectiveness of managing and planning their day-to-day tasks to be able to develop themselves further in being more productive.\n\nI have divided the software into two categories, and I will examine: software that already exists and can be used for task planning, and self-implemented software. In order to examine existing software, I conducted market research to gather information or find missing functionalities in existing and commonly used software, which I can integrate into my own software. My solution consists of two software applications: an android mobile application designed for data collection, task registration, and tracking, and a web application that processes the data collected by the android application for the user to increase productivity.']"," The main focus of the dissertation appears to be developing a software solution for efficient task planning and productivity enhancement. However, without more specific context, it is unclear exactly how _shards and hits are related to this problem or solution.

This is all speculative as the provided context does not allow for a definitive answer.","The main focus of the dissertation is to find a solution to help individuals optimize their task planning and productivity in an increasingly fast-paced world.

How is dynamic programming applied in computer graphics?,"[' The topic of my paper is ""Visualizing the Algorithm of Dynamic Programming through an Easily Applicable Interface."" Dynamic programming is an efficient and creative method for problem-solving. Its foundation lies in storing and reusing optimal solutions. It\'s a bit like a memory game, where by leveraging previous steps, you can more easily find the solution. This saves time and resources. Dynamic programming is used in optimization, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students. Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems and by solving these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples and practical applications, allowing them to see how dynamic programming can assist them in various areas of life, such as data analysis or video game development.\n\nBy incorporating unique interactive exercises and creative approaches, you pique students\' interest and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fosters the development of their creativity, logical thinking, and ability to work in teams. The goal of my paper is to present dynamic programming as comprehensively and uniquely as possible, thereby capturing students’ attention and laying the foundation for their future IT skills.\n\nI aimed to achieve this through a website, primarily because it is easily accessible and applicable to anyone. Furthermore, it was crucial for the visualization to be carried out through tasks that perfectly reflect the fundamental properties of the algorithm, such as dividing problems into subproblems and memoization. Additionally, I strived to create a user-friendly interface where the visualization speed can also be adjusted.']"," Dynamic programming in computer graphics is often used to solve optimization problems that can be broken down into smaller, overlapping sub-problems.

Nowadays, students are growing up alongside digital technologies, using smartphones, playing computer games, and actively participating in the online world. Compared to previous decades, forms of entertainment have undergone significant changes, greatly influencing modern education. Teachers need to employ new methods and techniques to sustain interest and stimulate further learning. Gamification, or the use of game elements, is a very important component of modern education and can provide an effective solution to changing teaching needs. I conducted a research study among students in Transylvania, where I gathered their opinions on the usefulness of various game elements in relation to learning. These game elements are all associated with gamification. Based on my own experiences, educational games can greatly assist the learning process. Their greatest advantage is that they allow learning useful things in a highly enjoyable and playful manner.

"Could you explain how Android applications can utilize pixel sorting methods to create glitch effects, and what challenges might arise in implementing these methods?","[' The topic of my paper is to examine and recreate pixel sorting methods within an Android application. There are a lot of possibilities to edit and correct our images, either with difficult image editing programs or with simple filters, with a click. To get the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods. Generally, you have to dispose of editorial knowledge, and it is a time-consuming operation. At present, there are few applications where you can apply this method simply and rapidly.\n\nThe glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from the same method due to the fact that every image is different. So, we cannot know what we achieve until we try the method on the given image. In addition, it belongs to such an area which is developing in our days and can be developed also by ourselves, given that there are a lot of possibilities, and the limits to create these methods are only what you can imagine.\n\nOn preparing my paper, I designed an application by means of which we can edit our images easily and simply, by the help of different glitch filters for pixel sorting. Behind the filters applied on our images, different pixel sorting algorithms make it possible within the application to achieve the desired effect. Each filter is sorting the pixels under well-defined conditions and criteria so that the effect should be as aesthetic as possible.\n\nIt was a challenge to find such methods which can work quickly also with a higher pixel number. Besides, it was important to experiment with those methods which not only sort but also modify the pixels on the image so that one can achieve a spectacular, aesthetic and pleasing effect. All these in a creative way by the aid of randomness, all the same with punctually designed algorithms.']"," In Android applications, pixel sorting methods can be utilized to create glitch effects by manipulating the pixel data of images or the screen itself. A simple example would be a method that groups pixels into _shards (small groups) based on their color values and then rearranges these _shards randomly within a certain time frame (_timed_out), creating a distorted, glitchy appearance.

However, challenges may arise in implementing these methods:
1. Performance: Manipulating pixel data can be resource-intensive and may lead to dropped frames (hits) or slow application performance if not optimized properly.
2. Quality control: Glitches should ideally look organic and aesthetically pleasing. Balancing between performance and visual quality is essential to achieve a desirable glitch effect.
3. Platform compatibility: Not all Android devices may support certain pixel manipulation operations, so ensuring cross-platform compatibility can be challenging.
4. User experience: Prolonged or excessive use of the glitch effect might negatively impact the user's experience, making navigation difficult and content unreadable. It is crucial to find a balance between visual aesthetics and usability.","Android applications can utilize pixel sorting methods to create glitch effects by applying different glitch filters that are powered by pixel sorting algorithms.

This is because there is no system yet which is able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interesting topic because with such a system, there would be no need anymore to recognize images or audio nor any cookie checking, like how Google bot detection works. Just a simple checkbox click would be enough. So in this thesis, I would like to analyze mouse dynamics performed by users inside a web application.

How do life events influence an individual's personality according to the context of the Eysenck Personality Test web application?,"[' The topic of my thesis is the development of a Eysenck Personality Test web application and the comparison of individuals and Large Language Models based on repeated administrations. Human personality is the phenomenon that makes us unique. Each person has a different personality, and while there may be similar personalities, no two people are exactly alike in the world. This phenomenon determines how we feel, think, and behave in different situations. How we see the world, communicate with others, and respond to challenges all stem from our personality. Many factors influence a person’s personality: genetics, family background, friends, experiences, and life events all shape it. The Eysenck Personality Test application attempts to measure specific dimensions of personality, providing insight into an individual’s characteristic ways of thinking and behaving. Its goal is to help users better understand themselves, track the development or changes in their personalities, and gain a better understanding of how they react to different life situations.\n\nWhen using the application, the user has one task: to honestly answer the test questions, without overthinking them, as responses should be based on initial impressions. Another important aspect is that the personality test requires multiple completions to examine different measurements. The results I get from the application help me examine the differences and similarities in the two entities’ personality traits.\n\nThe aim of the research is to understand the consistency and validity of personality traits based on repeated completions by comparing these two entities. Analyzing the differences in test results provides valuable insights into how these personality tests can be used to better understand personality traits and the functioning of language models. The application is very easy to use, and the test can be completed in a few minutes, with users receiving immediate results.

If an individual experiences prolonged periods of stress or anxiety due to life events, this could lead to increased neuroticism. Similarly, positive life events might contribute to decreased neuroticism. Extraversion may be affected by social interactions and activities brought about by life events. However, the specific influence of life events on extraversion is not directly quantified in the EPt, but changes in extraversion could occur based on the frequency and quality of social encounters resulting from life events. It's essential to note that the EPt does not account for the timing of life events (timed_out) or any specific shards (subfactors) within the dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion.","Life events are one of the many factors that shape an individual's personality, influencing how they feel, think, and behave in different situations.

what adobe after effects do?,"[' This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user-friendly mathematical animation software. The primary objective was to create a tool that simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student satisfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance.\n\nDespite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging. They often require hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere Pro. These tools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform-specific, limiting accessibility.\n\nTo address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations.\n\nInitially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users.\n\nAniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries. The software’s architecture was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features.\n\nKey features include a timeline-based editing interface, support for various mathematical objects such as points, lines, vectors, and functions, and export capabilities in multiple formats. The development process was thoroughly documented, and a promotional website was created to showcase the software’s capabilities.\n\nThe final product offers a powerful yet simple solution for creating high-quality mathematical visualizations, addressing a gap in the existing software landscape. AniMathIO also aims to be platform-independent, providing a desktop application that can be used on various operating systems. This ensures broader accessibility and usability.\n\nThe software combines the ease of traditional video editing software with the capabilities of advanced mathematical animation tools, making it an invaluable resource for mathematics educators and learners alike.']"," Adobe After Effects is a software application that allows users to create visual effects and motion graphics for video post-production, taking _shards (pieces) of footage and manipulating them over time.

what c++ does in image processing?,"["" Digital image processing has undergone an explosive development in recent decades, and it has become a part of our daily lives, even if not everyone is familiar with its basics. Digital image processing tools can be found in medical diagnostic instruments, space exploration tools, printing technology, phototechnics, industrial process control, and electronic gaming machines. Therefore, we can safely say that we use it in all areas of life, and more and more professionals will need to know about computer image processing. The topic of my dissertation is image processing on a web interface. Image processing is a method by which we can perform certain operations on an image to obtain an improved image or extract useful information from it. I have successfully implemented an application that allows users to utilize the functions of the OpenCV.js library through a user-friendly interface. During the design of the application, I ensured that the interface was user-friendly and easy for the user to navigate. In the end, I compared OpenCV's image processing functions in three different programming languages: C++, Python, and Java. The C++, Python, and Java OpenCV libraries have more functions than the JavaScript OpenCV library.""]"," In the provided context, C++ doesn't have direct relevance to image processing as the terms mentioned (took, timed_out, _shards, hits) are not typically associated with image processing in C++.

What is the Nash equilibrium in the context of two-person games?,"["" In a two-person game, the purpose of both players is obviously to win by following the rules and regulations. Therefore, each player resorts to the strategy that results in their greatest benefit. However, there are games where if one player applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, the set of strategy in which neither player can increase their profit by changing their strategy, if their opponent doesn't change their strategy, is called the Nash equilibrium point.\n\nIn my thesis, the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, both mathematically and from a programming perspective, using the prisoner's dilemma problem. Additionally, I will cover the following topics: the introduction of basic game theory concepts, the prisoner's dilemma, the presentation of an applied algorithm, and the interpretation of the result.\n\nTo compute this equilibrium point, I apply the Lemke-Howson algorithm.

How does ADAS benefit from image recognition technologies?,"["" In my thesis, I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays, there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations.\n\nRecent innovations rely frequently on image recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication, and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture's pixel values, we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas.\n\nIn order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy, this can lead to image recognition.\n\nIn order to achieve this, there is a need for the development of fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms. In this work, I am comparing different distance metrics for the computation of similarities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan, and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images.\n\nIn all the cases, I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-written digits and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean, and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies.\n\nI will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing distance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). At the conference, I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of the technology.""]"," ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) benefits significantly from image recognition technologies by enabling real-time object detection and classification.

How does the REST API function within the system for recognizing violence in homes using camera footage?,"["" Personal safety is playing an increasingly important role every day. As a result, the topic of my dissertation was the recognition of violence in homes using camera footages.

"What are the two types of documents that the application in the project is designed to digitize, and how does the software handle each type of document after it is uploaded?","["" The goal of my project is to create an application that makes digitizing documents easier. Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and institutions. My application can be used to digitize two kinds of documents: scanned paper documents and sound files. The software extracts data from each uploaded document, resulting in a computerized text file. Before saving the data from the document, it extracts entities (people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Additionally, it creates a summary of the text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text.\n\nThe other important function of the software is browsing documents. Users can search for, view, and download documents uploaded by other users. When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art software.\n\nThe software is made up of two parts: an Angular application on the client's end and a REST API on the server's end. This gives it the advantage that it can be further developed on the client's end, with a mobile application, for example.""]"," I don't have specific information about the types of documents the application in question is designed to digitize based on the given context.

What is the Rubik's Cube and how has technology made it easier to solve?,"["" The Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most iconic and most interesting puzzle games. The first Rubik's Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a Hungarian architect, sculptor, and game designer. Since its inception, it has become popular worldwide, entertaining millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik's Cube demands attention, patience, and strategic thinking from its user. But thanks to improvements in modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.\n\nThanks to improvements in our smart devices and automated robots, solving the Rubik's Cube has reached new levels. These days, Rubik's Cube solver applications are available on personal computers and smartphones, making the learning of new solving algorithms a lot easier.\n\nUsually, an application like this shows a 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution and show it to the user. The user can copy these steps onto his or her own cube, this way helping him or her develop his or her own skills.\n\nUsually, it's a plus if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the cube more. My software is able to read in a real cube using the camera of a smart device, this way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, which he or she can go through step by step, or if he or she feels like it, he or she can try to solve the cube himself or herself.\n\nAside from this, I wanted to implement a feature where the user can learn given solving algorithms. For this reason, there is a separate menu where the user can choose a solving algorithm and can see its steps on the cube. The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution, I used Kociemba's two-step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well-liked for its speed and low solution step count.""]"," The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor Erno Rubik. It consists of six faces made of nine square-shaped panels each, arranged on a 3x3x3 grid which are fixed together by turning five different colors along the four sides.

Technology has made it easier to solve the Rubik's Cube through algorithms and software. These tools take the puzzle state as input, apply a series of moves (hits) to reach a solved state, and show the sequence of steps (timed_out or took) that would solve it. Solving methods often involve shards of these solving sequences that can be combined to quickly solve more complex puzzles.","The Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most iconic and interesting puzzle games, created in 1974 by Hungarian architect, sculptor, and game designer Rubik Ernő.

The product is not the graphical interface itself, but the automated testing system behind it. The sole purpose of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is to create a better user experience and make the application available and usable for a larger audience.\n\nThe graphical interface is a desktop application implemented using Electron, a technology that embeds a website inside a desktop software. This can be installed and used on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. By doing this, we can have a product with high cross-platform compatibility and the ability to test local websites at the same time.\n\nThe application communicates with a server, which is responsible for project and user data management. This way, users can have the same exact experience from any device they access the application from.

what ecological footprint mean in this context?,"["" The topic of my research paper is the comparison of store prices: stores versus chain stores, based on shopping cart value. In this fast-paced and modern world, there's no time to read catalogs and brochures to compare prices. The problem is that there's a significant variance for the same shopping cart between stores and chain stores. Yet, there's a pressing need to address this issue because everyone's time is equally precious. The thematic concept is also justified by my personal experience. As a college boarding student, I had to be mindful of prices and where to buy the same products.

What is Flutter used for in mobile app development?,"["" The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in an efficient, fast, and secure way. People often find themselves in situations where they need help quickly, especially with health issues. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn't know where to go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context.\n\nAs we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist. However, for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and appointments on paper. Similarly, well-functioning applications in Romania are only used by larger clinics. Moreover, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts.\n\nTherefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.\n\nThe backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real-time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data.\n\nBut how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients but also to create a useful interface for doctors. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient.\n\nIn addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above.

The computer is expected to be as natural and smart as possible, making the game more enjoyable. As it can also provide a challenge to the user. This is why many game development companies are trying to put more advanced and smarter artificial intelligence into their games.\n\nThe aim of my thesis is to create an artificial intelligence for a 2D platformer game that can entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior. By complex behavior, we mean the following: if the opponent has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, the opponent should patrol. If the opponent has noticed the player, then the opponent should chase the player or attack the player if they are close enough.\n\nTo increase the intelligence of the AI, the A\\* path search algorithm will play a major role. This will optimally determine the shortest route between the player and the opponent. The opponent will chase the user-controlled character along that route.\n\nTo implement the game, we used the Unity game engine. We also loaded the A\\* Pathfinding Project plugin to apply the A\\* pathfinding algorithm.""]"," In a 2D platformer game, AI (Artificial Intelligence) could be used for implementing intelligent characters like enemies or NPCs (Non-Player Characters). These AI entities would take actions according to their programmed behaviors. For instance, they might time out before attacking the player or move and jump in specific patterns (_shards). In terms of game performance, AI may also be involved in hits detection and handling collisions between characters and environments. However, since the provided context doesn't explicitly state AI implementation details for a game, this answer is speculative based on common practices in game development.","The role of artificial intelligence in a 2D platformer game is to entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior. This includes patrolling when the opponent has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, and chasing or attacking the player if they are close enough.

What role did Târgu Mures play in the testing of the LearnIT application?,"["" With the rise of digitalization, the use of mobile devices have become a key enabler for today's young people, and there is a growing demand for interactive learning tools. The aim of my thesis is to present a quiz-based learning application that we have developed, which tries to put the time spent on the phone to good use. The main goal of the LearnIT application is to learn concepts related to different programming languages through interactive elements. Particular attention is paid to interactive quizzes that allow users to actively participate in the learning process. The application also has a teaching interface that allows the creation of new courses and questions. This allows teachers to personalize the course material and adapt it to the needs of the students, making learning even more effective.\n\nAfter the implementation of the application, I was able to carry out an experiment consisting of two parts: a test of the application I developed and a follow-up survey. The testing of the application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures, Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania. Using the application, the participants filled in different quizzes for several weeks in parallel with the educational material, and their answers were recorded using a scoring system defined by me. After testing, I processed a total of 25 students’ responses, almost 750 answers.\n\nThe answers and scores thus collected were examined. In contrast, the poll was designed to collect the subjective opinions of the participants. In this case, a total of 51 responses were processed. The results show that users had a positive experience, as reflected in the data and scores collected during the use of the application, as well as in the opinions expressed in the questionnaire.""]"," I don't know, as there is no direct relationship between the given terms (took, timed_out, _shards, hits) and Târgu Mures or LearnIT application in the provided context.","The testing of the LearnIT application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures, Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania.",0.0,0.0,0.777308490208188,0.194327122552047
