What are the benefits and challenges of decentralized messaging and data sharing in the digital era?,"[' Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications.\n\nThe traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives.\n\nDecentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed protocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decentralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information.\n\nSimilarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can securely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, decentralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.\n\nWhile decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data authenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.']","Decentralized messaging and data sharing offer several benefits in the digital era, including greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server.

how deep q-network help ai in games like liar's dice?,"[' Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, because they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy. due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behavior of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents.\n\nFor these reasons, Liar’s Dice is harder to teach to an AI, since neither the opponent’s move nor the game’s current state can be fully known, only roughly determined. But as the game becomes more complex, this becomes an even more demanding process for both human and machine players. In the game, players play with a given number of dice, and each player guesses by bluffing how many of a given number of dice are in play, and then it is essentially up to luck whether his guess is correct.\n\nThis is relatively easy to do with a small number of dice, as there are a finite number of possible moves.

how does password-free secure access work?,"[' In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication.

How are PDF documents used in creating property sale contracts?,"[' In today’s fast-paced world, individuals and businesses engaged in real estate transactions often encounter significant challenges when drafting property sale contracts. The creation of these property sale contracts is an integral part of real estate transactions, involving complex legalities and meticulous documentation. There is a pressing need for an intuitive tool that can alleviate these complexities and facilitate the creation of accurate and legally compliant contracts.\n\nThe aim of my thesis is two-fold. Firstly, I intend to create the basis of an online platform to allow the automatic creation of contracts for secure property sales. This includes the creation and planning of the necessary software architecture, the development of an easy-to-use administration interface, as well as the verbatim generation and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators.\n\nSecondly, I intend to document the various stages (and possibilities) of the final deployment, measured within real-world conditions. The proposed website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering users a friendly interface to generate legally binding contracts tailored to their specific requirements. By eliminating the need for extensive legal knowledge or the assistance of costly attorneys, the time and effort required to create a contract is greatly reduced.\n\nComparatively, governments worldwide have implemented similar software solutions to address the challenges associated with property sale contracts. However, these government-backed endeavors are often significantly handicapped by their perceived obscurity and their convoluted design choices. This platform aims to provide users with a unique and simplified experience that surpasses existing government initiatives.\n\nIn the beginning of the thesis, we will discuss the various technologies employed to create the proposed software solution. Afterwards, we will describe what the software will do and how it is expected to perform as part of a Software Requirements Specification. A prospective user interface for the platform will be detailed following the proposal of a potential software architecture and deployment layout. Finally, some measurements will be presented to rationalize the decisions taken during the planning stages of the software architecture.']","PDF documents are used for the verbatim generation and filling out of contracts using templates created by the administrators, facilitating the creation of accurate and legally compliant property sale contracts.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,,"According to the provided reference contexts, PDF documents are used in creating property sale contracts as follows: ""the verbatim generation and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators.""

what is mathematical modeling and how it help in understanding world and making decisions?,"[' Mathematical modeling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding, quantifying the impact of different changes on a system, and can also help to make tactical and strategic decisions.\n\nModels can be classified according to different aspects. Depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models. They can also be classified as classical or structural models.\n\nTo choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete. The modeling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, analysis, testing, and application.\n\nProblems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated.\n\nMathematical modeling came to the fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gauss, and A.J. Nicholson.\n\nIn my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the specified model: the integral method, the log-integral method, where I will use the Lotka-Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species; and finally, I will try to improve the results by particle swarm optimization.

The focus of my thesis is the online sale and purchase of products, using a mobile application I have developed. This application provides an excellent solution for the online purchase of wall pictures for home decoration purposes. It satisfies several aspects of the most important needs of the customers.\n\nThe app is easy to use, but at the same time it offers users several options that make it easier for them to select and buy products. After a quick registration, prospective customers can browse through the products. If they find a product they like, they can request additional information as well as add it to their shopping cart.\n\nThe final list of products from the cart and their price can be viewed, and users can finalize the order. After filling in the address, they can expect to receive the product that will be delivered to them shortly. Registered users can give feedback on products by rating them or adding reviews. This information is visible to everyone, so that customers can help each other in choosing the right product.\n\nThe web shop admin can upload new products, attaching photos for illustrative purposes. But even the admin cannot delete or edit the customers’ reviews. This can only be done by the user who added the review to the certain product, thus ensuring that the reviews remain authentic and objective.

What is the significance of the year 2000 in MRI histogram normalization?,"[' The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is its lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be interpreted in the context in which they appear. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other. In other words, they need a normalization. The most popular histogram normalization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al. in 2000. This method aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternatively, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with this method.\n\nThis thesis proposes to investigate which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques. And which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI datasets are involved in the investigation: one without and the other with focal lesions.

However, it does not specifically mention how MySQL was used in this project.

However, based on general knowledge about MySQL and database technologies, I can provide a concise answer:

In the recipe website project, MySQL would likely be used as a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage data related to recipes, users, and administrators. This includes storing recipe information, user profiles, and administrative data.

MySQL is different from other databases such as SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle in that it is an RDBMS, which means it uses a structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. MySQL also has its own strengths and weaknesses, such as being well-suited for complex transactions and having good support for SQL queries, but potentially requiring more resources and maintenance compared to other databases.

how bot detection work?,"[' The topic of my thesis is the analysis and synthesis of mouse dynamics applying different methods, and besides that, mouse dynamics-based bot detection. Several bot detection systems are known using different methods to distinguish humans from bots based on website usage data. Most websites use some image or audio recognition techniques or character recognition to distinguish humans from bots. This is because there is no system yet which is able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interesting topic because with such a system, there would be no need anymore to recognize images or audio nor any cookie checking, like how Google bot detection works. Just a simple checkbox click would be enough. So in this thesis, I would like to analyze mouse dynamics performed by users inside a web application. I will illustrate them, examine what kind of features I could extract from them to classify users more precisely. Then, try some method to generate synthetic mouse movement data sets similar to humans in order to deceive bot detectors. Based on user classification results, we can conclude that user recognition based on mouse dynamics has a low accuracy. However, using features related to screen resolution improves recognition accuracy. Synthetic trajectories based on Bézier curves can be easily detected by almost any classifier.']",Most bot detection systems use image or audio recognition techniques or character recognition to distinguish humans from bots based on website usage data.,,,"Based on the provided reference contexts, I can answer that bot detection works by analyzing mouse movements.

How do life events influence an individual's personality according to the context of the Eysenck Personality Test web application?,"[' The topic of my thesis is the development of a Eysenck Personality Test web application and the comparison of individuals and Large Language Models based on repeated administrations. Human personality is the phenomenon that makes us unique. Each person has a different personality, and while there may be similar personalities, no two people are exactly alike in the world. This phenomenon determines how we feel, think, and behave in different situations. How we see the world, communicate with others, and respond to challenges all stem from our personality. Many factors influence a person’s personality: genetics, family background, friends, experiences, and life events all shape it. The Eysenck Personality Test application attempts to measure specific dimensions of personality, providing insight into an individual’s characteristic ways of thinking and behaving. Its goal is to help users better understand themselves, track the development or changes in their personalities, and gain a better understanding of how they react to different life situations.\n\nWhen using the application, the user has one task: to honestly answer the test questions, without overthinking them, as responses should be based on initial impressions. Another important aspect is that the personality test requires multiple completions to examine different measurements. The results I get from the application help me examine the differences and similarities in the two entities’ personality traits.\n\nThe aim of the research is to understand the consistency and validity of personality traits based on repeated completions by comparing these two entities. Analyzing the differences in test results provides valuable insights into how these personality tests can be used to better understand personality traits and the functioning of language models. The application is very easy to use, and the test can be completed in a few minutes, with users receiving immediate results. After logging in, users can immediately respond to questions with ""Yes"" or ""No"" answers, and upon completion, they can compare their current result with previous ones if they have already done the test before.']","Life events are one of the many factors that shape an individual's personality, influencing how they feel, think, and behave in different situations.

what adobe after effects do?,"[' This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user-friendly mathematical animation software. The primary objective was to create a tool that simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student satisfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance.\n\nDespite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging. They often require hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere Pro. These tools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform-specific, limiting accessibility.\n\nTo address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations.\n\nInitially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users.\n\nAniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries.

What is the Nash equilibrium in the context of two-person games?,"["" In a two-person game, the purpose of both players is obviously to win by following the rules and regulations. Therefore, each player resorts to the strategy that results in their greatest benefit. However, there are games where if one player applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, the set of strategy in which neither player can increase their profit by changing their strategy, if their opponent doesn't change their strategy, is called the Nash equilibrium point.\n\nIn my thesis, the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, both mathematically and from a programming perspective, using the prisoner's dilemma problem.

How does ADAS benefit from image recognition technologies?,"["" In my thesis, I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays, there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations.\n\nRecent innovations rely frequently on image recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication, and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture's pixel values, we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas.\n\nIn order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy, this can lead to image recognition.\n\nIn order to achieve this, there is a need for the development of fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms. In this work, I am comparing different distance metrics for the computation of similarities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan, and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images.\n\nIn all the cases, I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-written digits and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean, and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies.\n\nI will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing distance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). At the conference, I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of the technology.""]","Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) benefit from image recognition technologies by utilizing recent innovations in this field to enhance their functionality.

What role does D3 play in visualizing data for the baccalaureate exam results?,"["" My thesis topic is implementing an automated system that aims to collect, clean, and visualize the baccalaureate exam results for Romanian students for the end users. The baccalaureate exam results are of paramount importance not only for students and teachers but also for educational institutions alike. These data greatly influence the future possibilities of students, whether it's about career opportunities or further education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools.\n\nVisualizing these results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of teaching programs. In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience, which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set.\n\nI felt the need to develop such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays. I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency and normalization for future use.\n\nThe user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations. The server-side application was built with the Nest.js framework, utilizing the TypeScript language, and it is responsible for managing and serving the data.\n\nThe foundation of the architecture consists of the scraper and cleaning systems. The web scraper was developed in GoLang, which is suitable for the efficient handling and processing of large data sets. For data cleaning and pre-processing, I used the Python language, specifically the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool.\n\nAdditionally, I worked with various other libraries and technologies, which will be discussed in more detail later on. The main goal in selecting the aforementioned technologies was not only to enable easy and fast access to the data, more accurate inference drawing, and better understanding of the result for everyone but also to ensure that the system is future-proof and allows further development.""]","D3, along with Recharts, is used for creating visualizations in the user interface implemented with the Next.js framework.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,,D3 plays a role in visualizing data for the baccalaureate exam results as it was used in conjunction with Recharts to create visualizations.
what is informatics and how does it relate to logic games and backtracking in this software?,"["" Nowadays we meet a lot of logic games in each of the corners of the online space, which we use with pleasure, irrespective of sex and age. Although young people are using these games the most, middle-aged and old people also play them with pleasure. For example: chess, mill, backgammon, and so on. Many want to develop competitively, but most persons play logic games for pleasure. The main purpose of logic games is the development of intellectual abilities and the useful and valuable use of free time. My goal in this work is to create software that includes a logic game. The basis of this logic game is a chess table. The essence of the game is that the player must place as many selected chess pieces as possible on the table without having them hit one another, following the rules of each figure's movements. The size of the chess table and the figures used on it can be chosen by the user. Using this software corresponds to educational purposes as well, with a professor mode that presents the correct solutions in informatics defined through the backtracking mode. To create this application, I used the programming language C++, and the user interface I realized using the Qt frame system application. This logic game offers pleasant time spent for anyone who knows the rules of figure hitting. Continuously, for students studying informatics at our university, it is an application for visualizing the backtracking mode.""]","Informatics in this context relates to the educational purpose of the software, which includes a professor mode that presents correct solutions through the backtracking mode.

What is the problem with plastic waste?,"["" One of the urging problems of today's society is the proper reuse of products. The 79 percent of plastic waste is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, 12 percent is incinerated, and only 9 percent is recycled. Inadequate storage and improper, ineffective recycling of products can cause enormous damage. Every year, more than a hundred million marine organisms die as a result of pollution from plastic waste. Selective waste collection can be facilitated by the automatic recognition of environmental product labels on waste. The recognized symbols, together with educational information, can provide sufficient knowledge for users to make the process of selective waste collection more efficient and easier.\n\nThe current thesis is part of the Greensy project, focusing entirely on the problem of automatic recognition of recyclable symbols. It solves this using various machine learning methods, with a corpus designed specifically for this purpose. By creating a data set, it is possible to recognize environmental product labels from a different approach than attempts in the literature so far.""]","The problem with plastic waste is that 79 percent is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, 12 percent is incinerated, and only 9 percent is recycled, causing enormous damage, including the death of more than a hundred million marine organisms every year.",,,"The problem with plastic waste is that 79% of it is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, causing enormous damage, including the death of over a hundred million marine organisms each year.

Who is Sebastian Sager and what is his connection to optimal control?,"["" Our world is highly complex, thus there are a lot of problems which we are not able to control. But the most dynamic systems can be written with mathematical equations, therefore we have some control over the system's behavior. The most frequently used method for this purpose is optimal control. With optimal control, we can solve the most linear and nonlinear problems that affect our everyday lives. The importance of this strategy speaks for itself, since it not only achieves results at an economic level (see Sebastian Sager [1]), but also saves human lives. For instance, the Dengue-fever was stopped in the 1960s: the disease's system can be written with a set of nonlinear differential equations, in which an educational campaign was also involved (see [2]). In the last few decades, optimal control has taken on enormous proportions, since these problems cannot be solved traditionally, with paper and pencil. In this paper, I will present two methods: multiple shooting and gradient descent. After that, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods.""]",Sebastian Sager is mentioned in the context as someone whose work demonstrates the economic results achieved through optimal control.,,,"Based on the provided reference contexts, Sebastian Sager's connection to optimal control is that he has achieved results at an economic level using optimal control, which saves human lives."
How does the REST API function within the system for recognizing violence in homes using camera footage?,"["" Personal safety is playing an increasingly important role every day. As a result, the topic of my dissertation was the recognition of violence in homes using camera footages. The established system detects dangerous and violent scenes using its built-in artificial intelligence module and then notifies the appropriate person. Besides that, the system performs space surveillance and intrusion control. Additionally, it's scanning for violence detection. This module takes the use of surveillance cameras to a new level. So, if abnormal events occur, it will notify the user as quickly as possible so that they can react quickly to adverse events. The notification process is the top priority, as it notifies the user of events only if the system has been designed to do so if there is actually a problem. For the implementation and operation of these functionalities, the android phone application provides a suitable environment. We will use artificial intelligence methods to examine what is happening in a variety of ways, including sound and image-based evaluations, to determine what is happening on the camera and then calculate the hazard factor. Four artificial intelligence modules work in the background through a REST API, which is closely connected to a TCP server, also responsible for managing the connected users and processing the recordings of the cameras belonging to the users. A third component of the system is the client application already mentioned above, which provides the ability to track cameras and receive alarm notifications.""]","The REST API functions as a connection between the four artificial intelligence modules and a TCP server, which is responsible for managing the connected users and processing the recordings of the cameras belonging to the users.",,,"According to the reference contexts, the REST API functions as a background process that connects the artificial intelligence modules with the TCP server.

How can anonymous feedback help teachers improve their teeching methods?,"["" The aim of my thesis is to analyze anonymous feedback to draw the right conclusions regarding a given topic. In real life, we often need feedback to make the right decisions and changes for the future. Anonymous feedback gives a more clear picture about reality than not anonymous feedback because it's in human nature that we don't give honest feedback or don't give feedback at all when its content is negative. For instance, when a teacher expects feedback from his/her students about the quality of lessons and teaching methods. In such situations, it's really important for people to get realistic feedback to learn, improve, and make the right conclusions. In this project, a user-friendly and efficient software was implemented which allows collecting, analyzing, and visualizing anonymous feedback. An initial version of this application was published at the beginning of this semester to allow for a case study. Therefore, students applying for the Object-oriented programming course had the opportunity to give anonymous feedback. The application allows registered users to create topics for which they request anonymous feedbacks. Within a topic, questions can be formulated to motivate participants for feedback. Feedbacks are collected, analyzed, and visualized using word clouds.""]","Anonymous feedback provides a clearer picture of reality because people tend to be more honest when their identity is not revealed.

how do programming techniques help in making a software tool for learning algorithms?,"["" The computer science gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the beauty of algorithms. As a beginner, we write and test short codes and browse the implementation of famous algorithms, learning about their logic's beauty. During our studies, we are quickly introduced to basic ordering algorithms and graph theory. While dissecting the ordering algorithms, an interesting question arose, and the answer was obtained by looking at an emerging problem from a graph-theoretic point of view. The problem led us to start investigating ordering algorithms using graph theory. This led me to develop a software tool to investigate algorithms using graph theory. In this thesis, I present the process of developing an algorithm testing software tool using different programming techniques.

"What are the two types of documents that the application in the project is designed to digitize, and how does the software handle each type of document after it is uploaded?","["" The goal of my project is to create an application that makes digitizing documents easier. Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and institutions. My application can be used to digitize two kinds of documents: scanned paper documents and sound files. The software extracts data from each uploaded document, resulting in a computerized text file. Before saving the data from the document, it extracts entities (people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Additionally, it creates a summary of the text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text.\n\nThe other important function of the software is browsing documents. Users can search for, view, and download documents uploaded by other users. When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art software.\n\nThe software is made up of two parts: an Angular application on the client's end and a REST API on the server's end.

What is the Rubik's Cube and how has technology made it easier to solve?,"["" The Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most iconic and most interesting puzzle games. The first Rubik's Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a Hungarian architect, sculptor, and game designer. Since its inception, it has become popular worldwide, entertaining millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik's Cube demands attention, patience, and strategic thinking from its user. But thanks to improvements in modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.\n\nThanks to improvements in our smart devices and automated robots, solving the Rubik's Cube has reached new levels. These days, Rubik's Cube solver applications are available on personal computers and smartphones, making the learning of new solving algorithms a lot easier.\n\nUsually, an application like this shows a 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution and show it to the user. The user can copy these steps onto his or her own cube, this way helping him or her develop his or her own skills.\n\nUsually, it's a plus if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the cube more. My software is able to read in a real cube using the camera of a smart device, this way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, which he or she can go through step by step, or if he or she feels like it, he or she can try to solve the cube himself or herself.\n\nAside from this, I wanted to implement a feature where the user can learn given solving algorithms. For this reason, there is a separate menu where the user can choose a solving algorithm and can see its steps on the cube. The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution, I used Kociemba's two-step solving algorithm.

What is Flutter used for in mobile app development?,"["" The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in an efficient, fast, and secure way. People often find themselves in situations where they need help quickly, especially with health issues. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn't know where to go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context.\n\nAs we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist. However, for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and appointments on paper. Similarly, well-functioning applications in Romania are only used by larger clinics. Moreover, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts.\n\nTherefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.\n\nThe backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real-time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data.\n\nBut how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients but also to create a useful interface for doctors. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient.\n\nIn addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above. The app not only facilitates contact and communication but can even increase the speed of effective patient care.""]",Flutter is an open-source framework for mobile application development that allows fast and efficient development for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,"Flutter is used for developing mobile applications efficiently, allowing for the creation of apps for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.",Flutter is used for developing cross-platform mobile applications that run on both Android and iOS systems from a single codebase.

"What authentication method based on behavioral biometrics was studied in the dissertation, and how was it analyzed?","["" These days, the security and maintenance of IT systems are very important. To access these systems' functionalities, authentication is required. Authentication makes it possible for users with the appropriate rights to access sensitive data. Authentication can be performed in various ways, one of which is biometrics - the measurement of characteristics related to life processes. Authentication systems can be divided into two categories: 1) access-based authentication and 2) continuous authentication.\n\nIn my dissertation, I studied keystroke rhythm in the case of password typing, which is an authentication method based on behavioral biometrics. Typing rhythm refers to the speed at which a person writes or types. This characteristic is suitable for identifying and authenticating a person. I divided the research into two major parts:\n\n1. In the first part, I examined which is the best performing anomaly detector in the world of typing rhythms. Here, I used the PyOD package and studied the detectors in it.\n2. The second half of the research was closely related to the first. I studied how I could compare the performance and illustrate the results of the measurements made. This is how the website component was born, which illustrates the measurements, summarizes, and highlights the important information. It has a teaching, didactic character.\n\nAll software created as part of this research is publicly available on GitHub.""]","The dissertation studied keystroke rhythm during password typing, an authentication method based on behavioral biometrics.

How have computer programs and algorithms changed the game of chess since the Middle Ages?,"["" Throughout history, only a few things, apart from minor improvements, have remained almost unchanged from the early Middle Ages to our present times and represent the same board game for millions of people. It has no hidden parts or any elements of chance; everything is in front of the two players from the beginning to the checkmate. Despite this, one of the biggest changes brought to chess came from the programs and algorithms created by computer scientists over the past decades. These offered a deeper insight into the world of chess, calculating the best moves from any given position, from an unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole new dimension of depth since we could analyze every single detail, and the most optimal strategy could be generated in mere seconds.\n\nWith my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to solve chess problems and puzzles that even thousands of years ago could have occupied people. My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess' complexity, is to clarify these algorithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.\n\nMy chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways. In a given example, they choose the best moves by analyzing the current situation or find a solution by testing all possible cases. By saving running times, I tried to present the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing ways with the help of the most effective methods.\n\nLast but not least, popularizing chess and arousing interest in it for others was another goal of mine since anyone can be an expert of the game of kings, and similar programs can help a lot in mastering it.""]","Computer programs and algorithms have brought significant changes to chess by offering deeper insights into the game, calculating the best moves from any given position among an unfathomable number of choices.

What is the role of artificial intelligence in a 2D platformer game?,"["" Using computers is now an integral part of our lives, and we use them for many things. Whether it's to do our work at work or at home as a recreational tool, such as browsing the web, listening to music, watching a film, or even playing games. Video games have gained immense popularity over the last decade. People like to sit down and play a game in their free time, either with friends or against a computer. The computer is expected to be as natural and smart as possible, making the game more enjoyable. As it can also provide a challenge to the user. This is why many game development companies are trying to put more advanced and smarter artificial intelligence into their games.\n\nThe aim of my thesis is to create an artificial intelligence for a 2D platformer game that can entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior. By complex behavior, we mean the following: if the opponent has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, the opponent should patrol. If the opponent has noticed the player, then the opponent should chase the player or attack the player if they are close enough.\n\nTo increase the intelligence of the AI, the A\\* path search algorithm will play a major role. This will optimally determine the shortest route between the player and the opponent. The opponent will chase the user-controlled character along that route.\n\nTo implement the game, we used the Unity game engine. We also loaded the A\\* Pathfinding Project plugin to apply the A\\* pathfinding algorithm.""]","The role of artificial intelligence in a 2D platformer game is to entertain and challenge the user with its complex behavior.
